Is it possible for trauma to calcify you until you’re too tough?
I was wondering, in cases where someone had repeat traumas that they got exposed to throughout their childhood, is there a chance that their emotional regulation doesn’t even out- like they get too tough or they don’t have a real baseline for what bad things are, so they’re able to handle even the worst situations surprisingly well, almost as though their bodies experienced too much horrible stuff to care at every little small thing?
