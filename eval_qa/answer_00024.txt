Our brains are designed to keep us alive, not keep us happy. We have a built in negativity bias, where certain parts of the brain, especially the amygdala, releases stress hormones like cortisol that override other brain regions and give us a stronger emotional response

From an evolutionary standpoint, the general idea is that if we're in a field of 99 watermelons, and 1 tiger, our brains will be much more likely to focus on the one tiger. Historically, those whose brains wired in this way were more likely to survive and reproduce.
I think this has something to do with expectation value as well, not just focusing on bad. If you expect to get a good score in both and get a bad score in one -> you focus on the bad score that doesn't meet expectations. However if you expect to get 50/100 in both and get a 90 in the other, you might just be happy about that and not concerned with the 50.
