Is there really no treatment/therapy to help narcissism?
When it comes to narcissism, it seems it is well known that most narcissists won’t get help. But when one does, is there really nothing to do to truly “help” them? Can a narcissist ever not be a narcissist? Looking for some articles on this, if anyone can link any. It seems there aren’t many articles/writings on this with great sources. Maybe this is because it’s not true? Thanks in advance!
