Therapists will see when the details are not adding up and that usually means a piece of the client’s story is missing. But, it’s our job to remain nonjudgmental. It may be that the client is omitting information, making up stories, etc. Or, it may be that that person has experienced immense trauma that has affected them in so many ways, one of them being that their perception of events is not always in line with reality. I agree with the commenter who wrote that we never tell our clients they’re the problem, even when their behavior is problematic. But we also don’t blindly support and encourage everything they do. It’s a balance of warmth, openness, and challenging perceptions with clients and every therapist does this differently. 

I wouldn't ever say a patient is toxic. I find some people more difficult to work with than others, or I find some people less sympathetic than others - which is normal and says more about me than them. But what can become obvious in therapy are things like dysfunctional methods of communication (e.g. expression of emotion/ needs/ boundaries). Usually it's because the person has never learned these things and in the long run they result in emotional problems for the person, who then ends up in therapy.
