What's the difference between task avoidance in ADHD and laziness in typical people?
The definition of being lazy is something like "willingly avoiding a task", which seems to align with how people with ADHD willingly avoid certain tasks for different reasons such as the task being mentally tiring, uninteresting, lengthy, seemingly pointless, etc... or simply because of the lack of motivation or learned helplessness (along with many other reasons).

How can someone accurately distinguish between the task avoidance in ADHD and laziness in typical people?
