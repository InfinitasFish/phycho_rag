It's a learned behavior for some folks.

For example, a kid gets punished every time they express anger. Eventually they learn that you're not allowed to show anger directly, and start to try other methods like avoidance.


Avoidance is a common technique for reducing psychological distress. In many ways it says less about you and more about the other person.

You can also look into attachment styles. When it comes to relationships there is something called avoidant attachment, which is an increased pattern of avoidance in romantic relationships.
