I would say personality disorders, they are often caused by trauma. Trauma disorders like ptsd and cptsd could fit aswell. But just remember that nothing actually calcifies in the human brain, those are symptoms which can be treated with the right therapy.
People who experienced developmental trauma may find that their brain and nervous system develop in a way that allows them to stay calm and handle the worst situations really well, but this is usually due to being able to function at a high level while disassociating. The body will keep the score with this and these people will often struggle to handle non crisis situations well or may be able to handle situations well but are unable to access the depth of their feelings which will negatively impact their ability for emotional intimacy in their personal relationships, or perhaps negatively impact their ability to feel positive feelings like joy
