Of 12 genes that have been confirmed to for sure be associated with either condition, both share 6 genes in common with each other. So they are related genetically speaking.

The previous DSM version excluded ADHD as a diagnosis in people with autism because the co-occurrence was so high (80-90+%). It was thought ADHD was part of autism (note the reverse is NOT true).

But then insurance rat flickery got involved and all ADHD med claims for people with autism were denied since there was no ADHD diagnosis.

The next version of the DSM was then changed so ADHD could be diagnosed in people with autism and their ADHD meds could be covered.

A lot of how autism is now described in the DSM is driven by treatment coverage more than a fundamental difference in diagnosis.

Both conditions majorly affective executive functioning and the ability to filter out irrelevant information, which the prefontal cortex is largely responsible for. I'm sure it's more complicated than this, but I think they're often comorbid at least partially due to lack of synaptic pruning in that brain region. Pruning unnecessary connections makes brains operate more efficiently, but with autism and ADHD you're taking in all available information without the ability to quickly intuit what's useful or not (or distressing, overwhelming, etc) like neurotypical brains can.
