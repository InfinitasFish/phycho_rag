
There are a lot of reasons, but to put it as simply as possible, a lot about what we believe—about ourselves, about others—is based on our own narrow, distorted points of view. The more closed off you are to other points of view, the more weight your own carries. Taken to an extreme, those who are unable to consider other points of view at all are completely absorbed by their own desires, regardless of what others think.
