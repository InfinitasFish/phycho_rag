Yes. To some degree, our emotions are shaped by how we (consciously or unconsciously) interpret bodily arousal. Sometimes it's more accurate and sometimes we misinterpret those signals. Like if your hands are shaky and you assume you must be feeling nervous about the current situation, when really it was just because you had too much caffeine earlier.
To add to this, we're all much more prone to mentally "misinterpret" our physical reactions than we appreciate. In a famous (among uni psych students anyway) study a woman would stop men to take a survey either before or in the middle of a long walking bridge over a deep ravine. After crossing the bridge they were approached by a second cohort who asked them to rate the attractiveness of the woman who administered the survey (none of this is particularly politically correct but it is fascinating).

The men the woman approached on the bridge rated her as SIGNIFICANTLY more attractive than the men stopped before the bridge. Basically the men stopped in the middle of the bridge misinterpreted their heightened state of anxiety from the precarious walking bridge as a heighted sense of arousal caused by the woman.

 Anxiety can present as fasciculations and paresthesia. There is a well documented phenomenon of medical students developing health anxiety, particularly around diseases like ALS and MS. Almost everyone experiences fasciculations and paresthesia from time to time, but medical students will sometimes (at significantly greater rates than the general public) interpret these as disease symptoms.

Anxiety from the pressure of medical school presents physically, those physical symptoms result in health anxiety, and that health anxiety exacerbates the original physical symptoms. A lovely (sarcasm) positive feedback loop.
