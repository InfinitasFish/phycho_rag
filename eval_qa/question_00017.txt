How can anyone be happy?
I genuinely donâ€™t see how anyone can be happy in this generation right now.. all I can see and hear is bad stories and Injustice, assaults, killings , liars, cheaters .. everyone says to look at the positives but honestly to me that is ignorance, will anything ever change? As if half of us will survive how the world is going.
