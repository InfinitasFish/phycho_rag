A lot of people spend significant time and effort to work on their athleticism and physical abilities. It’s an achievement. It’s a sense of accomplishment. It’s a goal. It’s self-care. It’s a hobby. It’s therapy. It makes people feel good about themselves. And we call that self-esteem.

I think it’s more than it being a hobby. People can get good at chess or painting too but it doesn’t grant them the same feeling of self worth and self esteem. Also “it makes people feel good about themselves” isn’t an answer to OP’s question.

I think it has more to do with 1) being fit having a direct relation to aesthetics and attractiveness, as people that are fit are usually thinner and more muscular which also helps someone’s face to become more attractive. And 2) feeling capable of doing more with your body and utilizing that in certain situations. For example knowing that if something happened (an emergency, a robbery, a housefire) you’re able to run fast, climb over things, lift heavy things, which immediately grants some sense of security. This isn’t evidence based but based on what I imagine to be important reasons.
