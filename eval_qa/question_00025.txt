What does IQ measure? Is it "bs"? My understanding of IQ has been that it does measure raw mental horsepower and the ability to interpret, process, and manipulate information, but not the tendency or self-control to actually use this ability (as opposed to quick-and-dirty heuristics). Furthermore, raw mental horsepower is highly variable according to environmental circumstances. However, many people I've met (including a licensed therapist in one instance) seem to believe that IQ is totally invalid as a measurement of anything at all, besides performance on IQ tests. What, if anything, does IQ actually measure?
