Why does the human brain prioritize grief over happiness? This is according to what I have observed.
Human psychology question- Why does the human brain weigh sadness over happiness? Like this: you score 90/100 in a maths exam which you thought you hadn't done well in, but you get 50/100 in a history exam you thought you had prepared well for. You get these results on the same day. As I have observed in such situations with myself and others, rather than getting happy over the maths results, you will get scared/sad over the history exam rather than being happy for the maths news. The happy news only serves as reassurance in these situations, at least for me and some of my besties. Even parents would scold the student over the history score before applauding them for the maths score, provided these scores are given in one go. Why does the brain naturally prioritize this "sad" score over the "happy" score, and such situations in general?
