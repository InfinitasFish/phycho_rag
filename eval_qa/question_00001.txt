Why do bad people rarely realize they're bad, and actually think they are good?

I know I'm using very simplistic, black and white language in my title.
 I know people are never wholly bad or good, but you know what I mean. 
There are people out there we could objectively call "bad people": 
they are unempathetic, selfish, self-absorbed, aggressive - 
the kind of people who would laugh at a little old lady slipping on ice, 
or not think twice about euthanizing a dog they no longer wanted to take care of, 
or take credit for someone else's work. I know people like this, 
and I'm always amazed at how highly they tend of think of themselves. 
They seem completely blind to their faults, even as they're actively doing/saying vile things. 
What's going on there? How can they be so blind to their own behavior? 
Is there anything that could snap them out of it?
