The assertion that narcissists can’t heal stems from people who have no patience to understand or deal with narcissism and shouldn’t be writing about narcissists.

Narcissism is the dangerous version of a trait we all have - ego protection. When someone insults you, and you counter them or ignore them, that’s a form of ego protection and it’s healthy.

But when you have a fragile ego (which comes from many different possibilities that we won’t go into) your ego defense is on hyper mode. This is narcissism.

So now, to heal narcissism, you need two things

The narcissist must see that something with the way they approach the world is affecting their relationships, and the gap between what’s tolerable and what’s intolerable must be enough for them to feel the only option is change.

The narcissist must trust the people in their treatment team enough to open up their wounds, confront them, work with them, be terrified in working with them, be okay with a world where those wounds no longer exists, and be willing to forgive themselves for the mistakes made while trying to protect their ego.

Now the thing is many narcissists never get to the point where the gap between tolerable and intolerable is enough to get them to seek help. When they get to that point, often they’re immediately scared off by the mountain of terrifying emotion work and pain ahead of them to heal.

That’s why most narcissists don’t heal, and many who do backslide.
