People can, depending on the situation, depending on what they have to go through, still feel empathy for others they dislike. Also, disliking someone is not necessarily fixed. The dislike can switch again to a more neutral feeling too. This is not a mental disorder.

The inability to feel empathy is from my point of view not limited to only people which are disliked or even hated, it's a general inability, no matter the type of relationship of feelings with the affected person. Narcissism is the first one that pops into mind.

This is due to the human psychology of othering, which results in the psychology of tribalism. Othering simply means that when you prefer one thing, you neglect another thing. So, having a tribe or family means you prefer your tribe or family over other tribes/families. Being you means you are in a position to see yourself better and prioritize yourself over others. Neglect of where we aren't focusing is a necessary part of focus, if you think about it.

Not having empathy for people you dislike is normal. But it's possible to develop more empathy for those people. You could try Buddhist metta meditation, which is for that exact purpose.
