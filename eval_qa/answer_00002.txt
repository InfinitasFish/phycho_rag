Childhood neglect significantly impacts an adults ability to engage in healthy relationships. Commonly but not in all cases you'll notice the following:

People pleasing tendencies or pathological deprioritization of needs

Conflict aversion or avoidance

Poor boundaries or none at all, guilt when beginning to assert even the most reasonable of boundaries

Insecure attachment (anxious, avoidant, or disorganized)

Assuming responsibility for the feelings of others

Can often be victims themselves of intimate partner violence and justify abusive behaviors

A lack of self-worth and feeling like getting basic needs met in relationships is a burden

Paradoxically, codependency or hyper independence

Difficulty trusting others
