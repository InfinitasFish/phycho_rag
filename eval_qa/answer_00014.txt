Avoidance doesn't allow for the processing of the traumatic memory or corrective learning. Basically, people need to let emotions, intrusive experiences, arousal, and other acute reactions run their course, talk to supportive people about what they're thinking and feeling so they can get corrective feedback, and not avoid external trauma reminders that are objectively safe (eg, noises, smells, sounds, public places/crowds)

One of the biggest predictors of recovery is social support. Two big predictors of PTSD are peritraumatic dissociation and trauma related guilt.

Basically, PTSD is a failure to recover from a trauma: something got in the way of the natural recovery process. Avoidance (whether it's intentional or not) results in recovery stalling out and the body stays stuck in the acute posttraumatic reaction that should have gone away over time. We expect most recovery to mostly happen by 3 to 6 months after, then it starts to plateau.

We know that the majority of people who have potentially traumatic experiences don't develop PTSD. Even among people who experience sexual violence, which confers the greatest risk for PTSD, less than 50% develop PTSD. Some people are therefore at greater risk of developing PTSD than others, even in response to the same traumatic experiences. Many factors help to explain this. Probably the most important is genetics, which is known to have an influence on PTSD via biological mechanisms in the brain. Social factors would include things like resilience (defined in various ways), social support and access to medical care. There are many other factors though.
