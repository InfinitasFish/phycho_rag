People treat happiness as though it is a state of being, when it’s only an emotion, much like sadness, anger, jealousy, etc. What people should be focused on is contentment and joy. These exist when we are able to acknowledge that despite all the garbage things going on around us, our existence is worth living and it’s overall positive. Being grateful without wanting more from something, appreciating the things you like about others and not making a big deal of the negative things (unless they are harmful/toxic of course), enjoying activities/experiences without needing to feel fulfilled by them, knowing that even if there are parts of us that we don’t like there are plenty of things about us that are great and we are also capable of growing, etc…. All these things are accepting what is good and positive weighed against all the crap. Choosing to focus on the positive isn’t ignoring the negative, it’s choosing not to let the negative dictate who you’re going to be from moment to moment. And when something really awesome happens, we need to be soaking in all of the positivity we can in those moments for the dopamine hit, because our serotonin receptors are all shot after being inundated by negativity by all forms of media on a constant basis.

I think that’s what it actually boils down to: we can’t find contentment because media and social media are being curated to keep us feeling uneasy and like things will never get better, which trains our brain to respond negatively, which decreases our effective serotonin receptors, which leads to mental illness, which leads to medications that are only semi-effective because they don’t fix the receptors in your brain, which leads to feeling like we’re unfixable, which makes us believe happiness is a myth. So we have to fix it by training our brain to fight against what media tells us. We are enough, we are worthy, good things are still good, and the negative doesn’t have to rule us.
