The concept is, external factors are affecting your nervous system, causing you to be dysregulated. We need to practice regulating ourselves, so that we are not overwhelmed and beholden to external factors for our well being.

-One crucial and key thing is consciously breathing, to regulate yourself. It's that easy. Specifically, breathing into your diaphragm (belly breaths). Look into Box Breathing or 3-part breath technique by John Wineland. When you're dysregulated, your breathing changes significantly and you may not notice it. When you consciously breathe into your belly, it will lower your heart rate and will help you become more regulated.

-The other thing is, what you tell yourself in those moments i.e. your Self Talk. In those dysregulated moments, you can start telling yourself "I can handle it" "I will handle it". Think about it, you've handled everything so far, whether positive or negative in your life. You can continue handling it and improving even further for the remainder of your life.

-Expand your awareness far beyond the space you're in. In dysregulated moments, your attention and awareness concentrates and shrinks and becomes hardened. You focus just on yourself. It's a survival instinct, for self protection. Try to ground yourself, and expand your awareness far beyond the space you're in. Have it expand to a space larger than you're in. Expand it onto the streets in your city, or to many buildings far away, expand it all the way to mountains or rivers even.
