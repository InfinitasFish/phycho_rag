It’s conditioned into us then many people “civilize” it into teasing or “poking fun” at people’s hobbies, interests, actions or decisions. Once we develop a behavior, it’s hard and it hurts to release it or suppress it.

Bullying is a moderate act of self-bolstering superiority or a tragic act of “self-love.” It’s a functional self-esteem boost which may have more positives than consequences for a person... so they do it until the negatives overwhelm them.

Then they may become bitter or recognize the issue and adjust.

They can be arrogant and insecure. They can be testing how far to push you. They can do it to make them feel better about themselves. It can be complicated to understand the motivation to bully.

I find it dishonorable to bully people at any age.
