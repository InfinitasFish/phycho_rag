What is the purpose of Depression?
Everything has a reason why it exists even if it was just evolutionary (like no natural enemies). I believe a lot of (mental health) issues are like a defence mechanism for some (more traumatic?) stuff with other disadvantages. But what is the purpose of depression? Or does it happen when the spirit breaks and "gives up"? Like when one gets unconscious from too much pain? Which is a defence mechanism.
