This, I think it is quite recognized now (for educators, parents sometimes have a hard time with this concept) that many "gifted" students have other conditions including autism spectrum disorder, adhd, and mental health conditions. 

As someone else linked, there's some evidence that the "giftedness" is related to neurological differences that often accompany other things. For example, perfectionism has been linked to eating disorders, suicidality, and poor resilience. Autism has been linked with burnout, and recovery from burnout takes longer for many autistic folks. 

On top of that, the conventional treatment of "gifted" students may actually be harming them in the long run. The pressure towards perfection and performance, the collation of their self identity with academic success, and the tendency to neglect other aspects of their development (especially social), all can cause serious problems for them as adults.
