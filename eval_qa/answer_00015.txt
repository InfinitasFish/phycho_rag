It depends on how you are using the term "narcissist", but in general, yes. If you are talking about the diagnosis NPD in the DSM, the criteria for the diagnosis is spelled out. In the psychodynamic use of the word, a different set of guidelines can be found in the PDM-2 or using the SWAP instrument. But in all of these cases, the label is based on observable phenomena.

I was just wondering if there are certain words or phrases a client will say that lets you know that the client is a narcissist?

It's not like a secret dictionary or set of keywords, but much broader. Narcissism is a description of a whole personality, how it hangs together, so it's far more a question of function, what they do with their words instead of which words they use.

Therapists can assess for narcissistic traits in clients through behavior patterns, self-centered attitudes, lack of empathy, and grandiosity expressed during sessions, typically observed over multiple sessions to make a diagnosis.
