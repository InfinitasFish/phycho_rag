
Yes. We don't just act on episodic memory but also on a lot of things that start being formed earlier than that. One example is your attachment style. How do you connect to other people? Also, things like proneness to anxiety get heavily influenced by early childhood experiences. Your primary caregiver is supposed to enable one a secure attachment style and for two encourage exploratory behaviour. Babies will often look back at their mothers before doing something like for example, using a slide at a playground or approaching another child or whatever. When the parents seem scared and discouraging for most of those things, the child will have the feeling it lives in a very hostile, dangerous environment and often have problems with anxiety later down the line. Children develop way better if parents seem relaxed, excited, encouraging, etc. When the baby tries out new things.

If a baby is not provided for emotionally and physically ( even with adequate food) they will not thrive- there are high mortality rates from orphanages that unfortunately we have learned from. Literally parts of the brain cannot develop without stimulation verbally and with touch . Neurologically the brain stem will not maturate to develop the higher brain centers. Without humans mirror reacting and acknowledging an infants existence with facial expressions to a baby like empathy key to brain development will not happen. . Thereâ€™s certain isolating behaviours that will develop as well , with the lack of stimulation- aggressive social development from isolation for instance will be the result. I just wrote these basics randomly- I cannot emphasise enough how the first years of development predict development, even mortality.
