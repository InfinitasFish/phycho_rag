Does anxiety ever start out physical and then become mental?
I remember reading an article (that I can't find anymore) that talked about how sometimes we will feel anxiety symptoms (i.e. tight stomach, muscles) for no reason, maybe just because we're so used to it, and then the brain will try and "fill in the blanks" as to why you're feeling that way. Usually it will be able to find some small thing to be anxious about, and that's why we get anxious about random things sometimes or get anxious and don't know why
