Well just like with so many of the disorders in the DSM there is a ton of symptomatic overlap and comorbidity between diagnoses. For example difficulty socializing can also stem from social anxiety and trauma or even something like schizotypal personality disorder. Unusual obsessions could be a part of OCD for some folks. Strong habit formation can just be a personality trait not associated with a diagnosis. At first glance this sounds like autism, but you would need to rule out things like OCD or schizotypal personality disorder or PTSD or anxiety disorders to get more information.

Now, when you put all these traits together, they likely point towards the diagnosis that has these traits as central features. So autism is likely, but to be sure you would have to “rule out” other potential disorders that can cause similar symptoms. This is why the process of differential diagnosis is complex and needs to be done by a professional.

Arguably you could say institutional autism is an example of this. Children who spend their infancy in an orphanage with severely reduced social stimulation (eg lying in a crib alone whenever they're not being fed or changed) often develop behavioral characteristics typical of autism, but if removed from the orphanage and placed in a foster or adoptive home, they tend to recover. They'll often have other ongoing issues, such as RAD/DSED, ADHD, conduct disorders, and mild cognitive disabilities, but the autism characteristics tend to fade within the first year of leaving the orphanage. Because institutional autism fades when they're removed from the environment that causes it, it's generally not considered true autism, even though they meet behavioral criteria for autism.
