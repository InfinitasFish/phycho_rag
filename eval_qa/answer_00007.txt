"Inability to recall key features of the trauma" is literally a criterion of PTSD diagnosis. You can dissociate when experiencing trauma which can make it harder to remember
here is evidence for memory disruption during acute traumatic exposure because of high arousal preventing memory consolidation. This is usually limited to disruption of encoding for specific details of a memory, but not large scale disruption. However, the concept of dissociative amnesia (or loss of memory for things beyond details in acute contexts) is exceptionally controversial and not supported by the best available evidence. Most reported memory dissociation due to trauma is subjective and is not objectively measurable, and memory repression is among debunked concept. Contrary to popular belief, the problem in trauma is being unable to forget, not forgetting too much.
