Is there scientific evidence for the "gifted kid to burned-out adult pipeline"?
I see plenty of anecdotal accounts of this phenomenon on Reddit and elsewhere, but is there any clear scientific evidence that children labeled as "gifted" are more likely to experience adverse effects later in life as a result?
