At the top of the list is get sober. I'm sorry but you can't convince yourself anymore that drugs are like an acceptable thing to do if you've got ADHD. If you have ADHD that is not well controlled and it's negatively impacting your life, honestly the first thing to do is to get sober. Second thing to do is ideally work with a dual diagnosis clinician who can do therapy to help you work through shame as well as like do CBT around ADHD and stuff like that and can help you like get into the process of recovery. Third thing that you can do is a dopamine detox. So this is going to be really tough for people with ADHD because dopamine detox, the primary problem is essentially boredom. We have a video about dopamine detox that y'all can check out. But dopamine detoxes are going to help you reset your dopamine levels, hopefully adjust that D2 receptor level in the striatum. And once that reset happens, hopefully the ADHD will get better as well. And like that sensitivity to reward stuff will sort of get normalized some. And then the last thing, the fourth thing, right? So fourth thing to do is to meditate. So meditation has been shown to strengthen the frontal lobes, improve things like impulsivity, improve things like your ability to inhibit and inhibit distractions, and focus your attention. And then the fifth thing to do is control your environment. So this is crucial because you do have impulsivity vulnerabilities. You do have distraction vulnerabilities. So if your environment is like a normal environment, other people may be able to not get that distracted, or if they do get distracted, they'll spend 15 minutes on Reddit before they go back to studying. Whereas your sensitivity to reward is so like out of whack that if you start on Twitter, your brain is going to love it so much that you'll lose two hours before you realize it. So you must, must, must be very, very strict about your environment if you are trying to do work. So I hope that's been helpful for y'all. I think unfortunately ADHD and substance use are two of the most challenging conditions to try to build a healthy life with. It's so hard because so much of our society is like, how can I say this? So much of our society prays on the vulnerabilities that the ADHD brain has. And as technology is getting more robust, as these mega companies and video game developers are like paying people millions and billions of dollars to figure out how to engage your attention and increase user engagement. to figure out how to engage your attention and increase user engagement, it's just praying on the ADHD brain even more and more and more. So it's really unfortunate that it's honestly like quite an uphill battle, but I don't know how to simplify it. I mean, I think our goal here at Healthy Gamer is to help y'all with this stuff, and helping y'all with this stuff starts with like an honest assessment of like where we are, right? If\"),\n",

So if you kind of think about that, these are actually all the weaknesses of a brain with ADHD. These are what where we know they're you know functional impairments. So there's a lack of attention right I'm not paying attention. I've there's a lack of attention, right? I'm not paying attention. There's impulsivity in ADHD. So I have to restrain an impulse, which is what people with ADHD sometimes struggle with. And then I have to use my frontal lobe to direct myself in the right direction. So this is fantastic advice. I strongly recommend everyone try it, but recognize that it's not gonna be as easy as it appears on the Tick Tock. And in fact, if you have ADHD, I mean, this is hard enough if you're neurotypical, but it's gonna be an uphill battle if you've got ADHD. Still good, good tip though. you.\"),\n",

You've got to deal with that shame which causes you to reach for the substance of abuse. The third thing that you've got to do is do a dopamine detox. So, this is going to be very hard for someone with ADHD because remember that your propensity for boredom is going to be like your tolerance of boredom is going to be super low. But the unfortunate thing is that you're kind of handicapped. You're stuck. Because if you're using the substance and you have the paradoxical effect of dopamine in the striatum, which is that over time you're decreasing your dopamine usage and remember that low levels of dopamine are correlated with ADHD, which means that your substance use is literally making your ADHD worse. So you've got to not only get sober, but do a dopamine detox. And give yourself a chance to reset whatever that dopamine circuitry is so that you can start to like respond in kind of healthier ways. Okay? And then the fourth thing that you've got to do is meditate. So I know we talk a lot about meditation on stream. We say it's like really good for all kinds of stuff. The reason I include it here is because everything that we're, all of the solutions to this are basically removing bad things right it's like getting sober going to therapy doing a dopamine detox it's all removal of stuff it's all of stuff. So the one thing that you can really do to like add, it's something that you can actively do, it's not getting rid of something, is meditate. And there's good evidence, overwhelming evidence, I would say, that meditation strengthens your frontal lobes, right? So that's where we go back to the idea of the prefrontal cortex. It strengthens things like your ability to control impulsivity. It strengthens your capacity to inhibit things, like inhibit impulses. And then the fifth thing to do is to recognize that your environment, that you are prone to particular weaknesses based on your environment. So you must very carefully control your environment. So let's remember what are the three vulnerabilities for people with ADHD and substance use? So you're more impulsive, right? And you can't control, it's difficult to inhibit behaviors. So if you are in a situation where there are going to be notifications and things pulling at your attention, your attention is going to use any excuse it can to not study. So if you give it any kind of excuse to not study, it will get distracted as easily as possible. So what I say very practically for people is think for a second about all of the things that could distract you from studying. So notifications on your phone, access to Reddit, you know, being able to alt-tab, using a laptop even, right? So using a computer or using your phone for schoolwork, because all of those things are going to make it easy for you to get distracted. So if you want to be effective, what you really have to do is control your environment because remember that you have like a high level of distractibility, right?\"),\n",

The short answer is we don't know. So I'd say like steer clear that stuff, especially if you're like a teenager or even your earlier, early 20s. So one person saying, how do I deal with the imposter syndrome of whether I might actually have ADHD or I'm just normal and lazy, especially since the waiting list for formal assessment is so long here. So if you're stuck between trying to figure out, am I lazy or do I have ADHD? Really common problem? Excellent question. What do you do about it? And this is where it's kind of interesting, but the short answer is it sort of doesn't matter, right? So like, I know it sounds kind of weird, but whether you have a diagnostic reason for being the way that you are, or you are lazy, you still have the same shared problem, which is that you're unable to do things. That problem needs to be fixed. Whether you have ADHD or you're lazy, like that's sort of in a weird way, it's almost irrelevant. It does become relevant because ADHD may open up additional ways to fix it. So I'm not saying it's truly irrelevant, but what I'm saying is that the situation is what it is. The ADHD is just a label that you put upon it, right? It may give you some amount of tools, it may give you some amount of options, but this is where I'd say that, you know, if there are tools to organize yourself with ADHD, they may help you even if you're lazy. So this is where, you know, your situation is what it is, irrespective of what label someone will give you. And so there are things that you can do irrespective of what label you have. So what is the nature and experience of your inability to work? Ask yourself that question. That question is the same whether you have ADHD or don't have ADHD. And then you ask yourself, okay, so like what is like what is it that makes it hard for me to work? Is it, is it, I feel unmotivated. What does that mean? What does unmotivation mean? Like, what does that mean to feel unmotivated? Is it that your mind is distracted? Is it that mean to feel unmotivated? Is it that your mind is distracted? Is it that you're afraid of the consequences? Is it that when you start to work, like you you automatically compare yourself to other people and you think there's no point in studying because this person is going to do a and you think there's no point in studying because this person is going to do a better job than I am. There are all kinds of things that can impact your motivation. And so you have to understand the nature of your experience. You're going to get more answers studying yourself than you will from like getting a particular label and finding external answers. And that may sound weird, you're like, but wait, if I have ADHD, doesn't that mean that there are all these solutions out there? News Flash is someone who treats people with ADHD, they're all on the struggle bus anyway. It certainly can help and there can be transformative, you know, interventions that you can do for ADHD.

Here\\'s what I want to say to you: it\\'s okay to start small and to take things at your own pace. You don\\'t have to tackle everything at once.\\n\\nFrom what you shared, it seems like you\\'re already taking small steps, like saying hello to people in your class. That\\'s a great start! Now, let\\'s build on that. What I want to suggest is that you try to identify what specifically makes you uncomfortable around people. Is it the fear of being judged? The fear of saying something stupid? The fear of being rejected? Once you can pinpoint what\\'s holding you back, we can work on strategies to overcome those fears.\\n\\nOne thing that might help is to focus on the present moment. Instead of worrying about what might happen in the future or what people might think of you, try to stay present and engaged in the conversation. Ask yourself, \"What\\'s happening right now?\" and focus on that. This can help you feel more grounded and less anxious.\\n\\nAnother thing that might help is to find people who share similar interests or values. When you connect with others on a deeper level, it can make it easier to feel more comfortable around them. You might also want to try to find social situations that feel more relaxed and low-key, like hanging out with friends or joining a club or group that aligns with your interests.\\n\\nAnd here\\'s the thing: it\\'s okay to make mistakes! You\\'re not going to be perfect, and that\\'s okay. What\\'s important is that you\\'re trying and that you\\'re willing to learn and grow. So, don\\'t be too hard on yourself if things don\\'t go exactly as planned.\\n\\nLastly, remember that you\\'re not alone in this. Many people struggle with social anxiety, and there are plenty of resources available to help. You might want to consider talking to a therapist or counselor who has experience working with social anxiety. They can help you develop coping strategies and provide support as you work through your fears.\\n\\nSo, what do you think? Are you willing to start small and take things one step at a time? Are you willing to focus on the present moment and try to connect with others on a deeper level? Are you willing to make mistakes and learn from them? If so, I\\'m here to support you every step of the way.'"

              "'The question of why some people may struggle to recognize their own negative behaviors and motivations is a complex one. As a psychological assistant, I\\'d like to offer some insights based on the retrieved context.\\n\\nFrom the context, it appears that you\\'re referring to individuals who exhibit behaviors that can be perceived as \"bad\" or harmful towards others, yet they may not recognize or acknowledge the harm they\\'re causing. This phenomenon can be attributed to various psychological and social factors.\\n\\nOne possible explanation is that these individuals may be conditioned to prioritize their own interests and needs over those of others. This conditioning can occur through various means, such as upbringing, social environment, or even genetics.

Some possible indicators of childhood neglect that may persist into adulthood include:\\n\\n1. Emotional regulation difficulties: Children who experienced neglect may have developed maladaptive coping mechanisms to manage their emotions, which can manifest as anxiety, irritability, or mood swings in adulthood.\\n2. Attachment issues: Neglect can impact attachment styles, leading to difficulties in forming and maintaining healthy relationships. Adults who experienced childhood neglect may struggle with intimacy, trust, or emotional connection with others.\\n3. Self-esteem and self-worth issues: Neglect can shape an individual's self-perception, leading to low self-esteem, self-doubt, or self-blame. Adults who experienced childhood neglect may struggle with confidence, self-acceptance, or self-compassion.\\n4. Trauma-related symptoms: Neglect can be traumatic, and adults who experienced it may exhibit symptoms such as hypervigilance, flashbacks, or nightmares, which can be triggered by environmental stimuli or internal cues.\\n5. Dissociation: Neglect can lead to dissociation, which is a coping mechanism that involves disconnection from one's thoughts, feelings, or memories. Adults who experienced childhood neglect may exhibit dissociative behaviors, such as depersonalization, derealization, or identity fragmentation.\\n6. Substance abuse or addiction: Neglect can increase the risk of substance abuse or addiction in childhood and adulthood, as individuals may use substances as a coping mechanism for emotional pain or to self-medicate.\\n7. Self-sabotaging behaviors: Neglect can shape an individual's self-perception, leading to self-sabotaging behaviors, such as procrastination, self-doubt, or self-destructive tendencies.\\n8. Difficulty with emotional expression: Neglect can lead to difficulties in expressing emotions, which can manifest as emotional numbness, flat affect, or difficulty articulating feelings.\\n9. Trust issues: Neglect can erode trust in others, leading to difficulties in forming and maintaining healthy relationships in adulthood.\\n10. Sensitivity to criticism: Neglect can increase sensitivity to criticism, which can lead to feelings of shame, guilt, or self-blame.\\n\\nIt's essential to note that these signs and symptoms can vary widely depending on the individual's unique experiences and circumstances. Additionally, not everyone who experienced childhood neglect will exhibit these symptoms, and not everyone who exhibits these symptoms necessarily experienced childhood neglect.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while it's challenging to pinpoint specific signs or symptoms of childhood neglect in adulthood, it's crucial to recognize that neglect can have a profound impact on an individual's emotional, social, and cognitive development. By acknowledging these potential indicators and seeking support, individuals who experienced childhood neglect can work towards healing, growth, and recovery.\"}]\n",

Studies have shown that around 30-50% of individuals with autism also have ADHD, while in the general population, the prevalence of ADHD is around 5-10%.\\n\\nSeveral factors may contribute to the co-occurrence of autism and ADHD:\\n\\n1. Shared genetic predispositions: Both autism and ADHD are thought to have a strong genetic component, and research suggests that there may be shared genetic risk factors that contribute to the development of both conditions.\\n2.

You\\'re asking if repeated trauma can lead to a kind of emotional desensitization or numbness, making it difficult for an individual to regulate their emotions.\\n\\nResearch suggests that repeated trauma can indeed lead to emotional regulation difficulties, including increased emotional numbness or detachment. This can occur due to various factors, such as neurobiological changes, emotional coping mechanisms, and environmental factors. However, it\\'s essential to note that trauma can have a profound impact on an individual\\'s emotional, social, and cognitive development, and it\\'s not a simple process of \"calcification.\"\\n\\n2. Is it possible for your brain to forget about things or people who caused trauma? Like legit memory loss?\\n\\nIt\\'s not uncommon for individuals who have experienced trauma to report difficulty remembering certain details or events related to the trauma. This can be due to various factors, such as:\\n\\n* Dissociation: Trauma can lead to dissociation, a coping mechanism that involves disconnection from one\\'s thoughts, feelings, or memories.\\n* Emotional regulation: Trauma can make it difficult for individuals to regulate their emotions, leading to a kind of emotional numbness or detachment that can affect memory.\\n* Neurobiological changes: Trauma can alter the structure and function of the brain\\'s emotional regulation systems, leading to difficulties in processing and regulating emotions.\\n\\nHowever, it\\'s important to note that trauma-related memory loss is not the same as genuine memory loss. Trauma can lead to a kind of \"functional memory loss,\" where the brain is unable to access or retrieve memories related to the trauma due to emotional regulation difficulties or dissociation. This is different from genuine memory loss, which is a neurological condition characterized by the inability to form or retrieve memories.\\n\\nI hope this helps clarify things!

So check out our video on Alexathymia if you all want to. And then you can even tell your therapist that, hey, I'm concerned that I'm a little bit of lexathimic. So you're signaling to them that you may not be able to participate in therapy in a default way. The next thing that you can do is ask your therapist to change their style a little bit if it isn't working for you. So you can tell them, hey, I've noticed that you're really quiet and then you kind of ask these questions like how do you feel over and over and over again? And then I keep answering I don't know. Can you try to be a little bit more active or offer a little bit more guidance instead of being quieter and asking only open-ended questions. Can you help me understand stuff or guide me in some way? And some therapists may feel really uncomfortable with that. They may turn that around into a question. Why do you feel like you need more guidance? I don't know, because this doesn't seem to be helping very much. So you can just ask them to change their style a little bit. And the third thing that you can do if number one and number two don't work is after two or three sessions I would just go to them and say, hey, I don't feel like I'm actually getting a whole lot out of this therapy. So you seem to be asking certain questions that I have difficulty answering and I'm hoping that you can recommend a different therapist Who's a little bit more active can offer a little bit more guidance or asks questions in a way that can help me understand my emotions better. And I know that this sounds mortifying, oh my God, as a dude, why would I ever do that? As anyone, as any patient, why would I ask to see a different therapist? It means that I don't think they're good. And it doesn't mean that they're not good. It just means that they're not really helping you very much. Or at the minimum, you can have a conversation about what's working and what isn't, and then hopefully y'all can work through that stuff. So I as a therapist actually don't feel, I mean, I feel bad in some ways, but I'm really grateful for all of my patients who have come to me and said, hey, Dr. K, this is not working. Because then one of two things happen. One is either we work on it, and then we actually make a breakthrough of some kind and now we're really jiving together, or I recommend that the person go see someone else. And what's my duty as a doctor or someone's duty as a therapist? It's to help the person, not help the person myself. It means giving that person whatever kind of help they need. So oddly enough, I'm still recommending that y'all try psychotherapy, because it is still an evidence-based, very effective approach. The other thing to consider, though, is that a lot of emotions live in our body, and as men, sometimes we need to do more bodily stuff. So there are studies that show that Tai Chi and yoga, for example, are effective treatments for a lot of things like mood disorders or\\n- for you.

So ask yourself if you get something that makes you feel bad and you're taking it personally you feel like a POS. Look at the other person's perspective and ask what are they seeing. Now the other thing that you can do is literally ask them. What are you seeing that I'm doing, what are the behaviors that bother you, what are the words that bother you, like help me understand. So what we want to do is try to externalize our perception and look at ourselves, or look at what they see. The next thing that we want to do is try to focus on when you say I am a POS and you take things personally. That is going to result in once again, certain manifestations. So what are the manifestations? Is it that I don't text people back fast enough? Is it that what is that what are the manifestations of being a POS and as you examine the manifestations you are going to start to discover things over here and then comes the most important step is once you start to isolate these things and this is a beautiful thing. They don't even need to be right, right? So a lot of my patients will get hung up. What if I'm wrong about this? Right? What if I'm wrong about, let's say, this person says I'm not invested in the friendship. And I ask them, okay, what does this person see? Well, they text me and I don't text them back. And then my patients will ask, well, what if I'm wrong? What if that's the wrong thing and that's not really the problem that is in the relationship? This is where I say, I don't care. What do you, how do you feel about texting people back more frequently? Like, do you think that would improve your life in some way? Do you think that would improve your life in some way? Do you think that that could help? May help your other relationships as well. So as you take this, as you take this approach, you're going to start to isolate these kinds of things, and then you're going to\\n- of therapy? Just think about this, the therapist is like he needs to understand why he's lost his privileges. What the fuck? The therapist isn't even bothering to ask why are you playing games in the first place? The why do you think the kid isn't going into therapy? It's because the kid doesn't have a voice. It's like therapy is being used as a tool of manipulation and control by the dad. He needs to articulate why he's been a bad boy and we took the games away. Then he'll get them back. Maybe the purpose of therapy is to ask the kid, what's going on, man? Why are you playing the games? Are you struggling? What's it been like being at home? Like, maybe start there. Maybe start by actually engaging with your child and asking them, what's going on with you it seems like you're struggling? Can I help? Maybe ask your kid can I help instead of here let me fix it for you and punish you with a side of punishment. Here's a here's a main course. Here's a fix-it burger with a side of punishment. Maybe ask, can I help? What's going on? Try to understand. Because now the kid has figured out the Trump card. Okay? Psychosomatic illness. So I've seen this so much. So like, you know, I arguably I specialize in a lot of things, but I'd say like at some point 30 or 40 percent of like the referrals that I got were people with psychosomatic illness. So psychosomatic illness is like one of these things where there's some kind of symptom, and we'll talk about this in a second. There's like some kind of symptom or like illness that like can't be medically explained. So headaches are a good example of this. Brain fog is another good example of this. IBS or irritable bowel syndrome. Pots, postural, orthostatic, tachycardic syndrome is another good example of this. Various autoimmune conditions. Fibromyalgia, CPRS, sorry, CRPS, complex regional pain syndrome, like eczema, headaches, like these are all things that are psychosomatic in nature.

One is either we work on it, and then we actually make a breakthrough of some kind and now we're really jiving together, or I recommend that the person go see someone else. And what's my duty as a doctor or someone's duty as a therapist? It's to help the person, not help the person myself. It means giving that person whatever kind of help they need. So oddly enough, I'm still recommending that y'all try psychotherapy, because it is still an evidence-based, very effective approach. The other thing to consider, though, is that a lot of emotions live in our body, and as men, sometimes we need to do more bodily stuff. So there are studies that show that Tai Chi and yoga, for example, are effective treatments for a lot of things like mood disorders or anxiety or things like that. So adding a physical component to your emotional health is very, very helpful. The other thing to consider is that there's a range of new and kind of in vogue things called somatic therapies. So these are therapies that incorporate the body in some way. So good examples of this are EMDR or EFT, which is the emotional freeing technique or tapping. So when I first encountered these studies about 10 or 15 years ago, and I used to sort of, my area of interest was evidence-based complementing alternative medicine. I thought all this stuff was like kind of BS, right? So it's like the idea behind tapping is that your emotions are stored in your body and that you can tap on certain parts to free emotions. And I was like, this doesn't make any sense, this is all BS. And it turns out that over the last decade or so, there have been some studies that actually show that this is a pretty effective technique. We're not really 100% sure. You know, the studies aren't super high quality, but there's more and more evidence that stuff that is not classically effective may be effective. And specifically that a lot of somatic therapies seem to be gaining a lot of weight and\\n- to regulate their emotions results in three coping strategies. Avoidance, suppression, or reappraisal. Avoidance is when we kind of mentally check out from the thing, we either avoid the situation entirely. We literally don't go. So we can physically check out of the situation or what we'll do is mentally check out of the situation. So we'll even go to the place, but we'll devalue something in my mind so that it doesn't, I don't have to be hurt by it, right? So I kind of go AFK in a situation. That's absolutely a tactic used to overcome my disordered emotions to begin with. It's a coping mechanism. So healthier than that is suppression where at least I feel the emotion, but I push it down. So there's internal conflict versus mentally checking out. And then the third and healthiest thing is reappraisal, which is when I kind of work through the emotion I end up like looking at the emotion and I end up like looking at the silver lining or realizing that okay even though I got you know even though my partner dumped me like in the grand scheme of things like there are other people out there I learned a lot from the relationship. I'm going to know better what mistakes not to make next time. That's an example of reappraisal. So we can see how apathy to success absolutely falls into that avoidance category as a coping strategy against your difficult emotional regulation, which we once again know that people with ADHD have. So that's consistent, apathetic with success. The last thing that I'll mention, which is a little bit different, which is a little bit more from the yogic perspective or the Eastern perspective, is when you're a child with ADHD, and it's hard for you to succeed because you have certain neurological disadvantages in terms of like attention and things like that. One of the things that you have to learn how to do is divorce yourself from success. And this is a protective mechanism. So I want you to put yourself in the shoes of like a 12-year-old who has\\n- don't stress about it. Now if you guys want some of these techniques of how to observe and things like that, I definitely recommend you check out our meditation guide. We'll teach you about a lot of this mental training. But all you need to do is observe the vassana. So at the end of the day, you'll need to be a little bit careful about venting. Venting can be absolutely healthy if it precedes action, if it helps stabilize you because too much negative emotion is overwhelming. We want to modulate that negative emotion down to where we still have enough emotional energy to motivate to act. This is what a therapist does, but if you don't do this, if instead you just vent for the sake of venting and then you vent again and vent again, vent again, you're forming a mental habit. And then the real problem with that mental habit is that mental habit will make it harder for you to do something because now your body has a habituated response. When this problem happens, how do I deal with it? I bitch about it. So now it becomes harder and harder and harder. It's kind of like, you know, once you train yourself to be right-handed It's it's hard to start writing with your left hand So once your mind trains with a particular vassina of this is how I'm going to deal with this problem, I'm just going to bitch about it, it becomes harder and harder and harder to work with your left hand to actually do something about your problem. So be careful about venting and observe your vassanas. you\\n- self-compassion? And this is what's really important to understand. Is that for about half of patience, the single most revolutionary thing you can do for them is to teach them self-love. So I think the reason that we're biased this way as the field of therapy is because for half of the people, if we can teach them self-compassion, all of their problems will be fixed. And that's kind of the goal of therapy, right? That's the approach, is that like, the problem isn't that you lack knowledge to solve this particular thing. The problem is that there knowledge to solve this particular thing. The problem is that there's something inside you that as long as it's broken and isn't really functioning properly, you can try to go on fixing things out there and it'll never work. And that's a really valid approach. Like literally in my practice, I'd say like the most transformative thing is teaching people self-love, but for half the people. The real problem is that for the other half it doesn't seem to work Because not everyone is traumatized and not everyone sort of needs more self-love and self-compassion and in, for half the people that walk into my office, if I tell them, hey, bro, you need more self-love. They hate it. Because these are people, and you may be one of them, that don't deserve self-love that don't deserve self-love. You don't deserve compassion, because you suck at life, right? And like, I'm not here to teach myself how to love this pathetic version of me. This is not what I'm interested in. I actually don't want to love this person. Give yourself love to someone who deserves it. What I actually want to do is create a life that I can be proud of. Something where I deserve love and confidence and like all that good stuff is like appropriate. And if people come into our office that way, unfortunately a lot of my colleagues will be like, no, no, you need to suffer love, eh, eh, you are to self love. Yeah, eh. You are deserving of love. You're not pathetic. Like\"}]\n",

One is either we work on it, and then we actually make a breakthrough of some kind and now we're really jiving together, or I recommend that the person go see someone else. And what's my duty as a doctor or someone's duty as a therapist? It's to help the person, not help the person myself. It means giving that person whatever kind of help they need. So oddly enough, I'm still recommending that y'all try psychotherapy, because it is still an evidence-based, very effective approach. The other thing to consider, though, is that a lot of emotions live in our body, and as men, sometimes we need to do more bodily stuff. So there are studies that show that Tai Chi and yoga, for example, are effective treatments for a lot of things like mood disorders or anxiety or things like that. So adding a physical component to your emotional health is very, very helpful. The other thing to consider is that there's a range of new and kind of in vogue things called somatic therapies. So these are therapies that incorporate the body in some way. So good examples of this are EMDR or EFT, which is the emotional freeing technique or tapping. So when I first encountered these studies about 10 or 15 years ago, and I used to sort of, my area of interest was evidence-based complementing alternative medicine. I thought all this stuff was like kind of BS, right? So it's like the idea behind tapping is that your emotions are stored in your body and that you can tap on certain parts to free emotions. And I was like, this doesn't make any sense, this is all BS. And it turns out that over the last decade or so, there have been some studies that actually show that this is a pretty effective technique. We're not really 100% sure. You know, the studies aren't super high quality, but there's more and more evidence that stuff that is not classically effective may be effective. And specifically that a lot of somatic therapies seem to be gaining a lot of weight and\\n- to regulate their emotions results in three coping strategies. Avoidance, suppression, or reappraisal. Avoidance is when we kind of mentally check out from the thing, we either avoid the situation entirely. We literally don't go. So we can physically check out of the situation or what we'll do is mentally check out of the situation. So we'll even go to the place, but we'll devalue something in my mind so that it doesn't, I don't have to be hurt by it, right? So I kind of go AFK in a situation. That's absolutely a tactic used to overcome my disordered emotions to begin with. It's a coping mechanism. So healthier than that is suppression where at least I feel the emotion, but I push it down. So there's internal conflict versus mentally checking out. And then the third and healthiest thing is reappraisal, which is when I kind of work through the emotion I end up like looking at the emotion and I end up like looking at the silver lining or realizing that okay even though I got you know even though my partner dumped me like in the grand scheme of things like there are other people out there I learned a lot from the relationship. I'm going to know better what mistakes not to make next time. That's an example of reappraisal. So we can see how apathy to success absolutely falls into that avoidance category as a coping strategy against your difficult emotional regulation, which we once again know that people with ADHD have. So that's consistent, apathetic with success. The last thing that I'll mention, which is a little bit different, which is a little bit more from the yogic perspective or the Eastern perspective, is when you're a child with ADHD, and it's hard for you to succeed because you have certain neurological disadvantages in terms of like attention and things like that. One of the things that you have to learn how to do is divorce yourself from success. And this is a protective mechanism. So I want you to put yourself in the shoes of like a 12-year-old who has\\n- don't stress about it. Now if you guys want some of these techniques of how to observe and things like that, I definitely recommend you check out our meditation guide. We'll teach you about a lot of this mental training. But all you need to do is observe the vassana. So at the end of the day, you'll need to be a little bit careful about venting. Venting can be absolutely healthy if it precedes action, if it helps stabilize you because too much negative emotion is overwhelming. We want to modulate that negative emotion down to where we still have enough emotional energy to motivate to act. This is what a therapist does, but if you don't do this, if instead you just vent for the sake of venting and then you vent again and vent again, vent again, you're forming a mental habit. And then the real problem with that mental habit is that mental habit will make it harder for you to do something because now your body has a habituated response. When this problem happens, how do I deal with it? I bitch about it. So now it becomes harder and harder and harder. It's kind of like, you know, once you train yourself to be right-handed It's it's hard to start writing with your left hand So once your mind trains with a particular vassina of this is how I'm going to deal with this problem, I'm just going to bitch about it, it becomes harder and harder and harder to work with your left hand to actually do something about your problem. So be careful about venting and observe your vassanas. you\\n- self-compassion? And this is what's really important to understand. Is that for about half of patience, the single most revolutionary thing you can do for them is to teach them self-love. So I think the reason that we're biased this way as the field of therapy is because for half of the people, if we can teach them self-compassion, all of their problems will be fixed. And that's kind of the goal of therapy, right? That's the approach, is that like, the problem isn't that you lack knowledge to solve this particular thing. The problem is that there knowledge to solve this particular thing. The problem is that there's something inside you that as long as it's broken and isn't really functioning properly, you can try to go on fixing things out there and it'll never work. And that's a really valid approach. Like literally in my practice, I'd say like the most transformative thing is teaching people self-love, but for half the people. The real problem is that for the other half it doesn't seem to work Because not everyone is traumatized and not everyone sort of needs more self-love and self-compassion and in, for half the people that walk into my office, if I tell them, hey, bro, you need more self-love.

The other thing, you're all going to love this, social, non-assertive communication. So sometimes this is social anxiety or we call this social anxiety. I'm not saying that they have a social anxiety disorder. What I'm saying is that people who are socially non-assertive with communication have difficulty walking up to someone and initiating a conversation. They have difficulty advocating for themselves, right? They're non-assertive in their communication style, so they're passive. So this is their communication style, so they're passive. So this is the person who will go to a party and will stand there in the corner and wait for someone to talk to them. And we call that social anxiety. But this is actually associated with Alexithymia. Okay, next thing, this is the beta mindset, right? So I'm going to draw a pretty broad correlation here. I'm not saying that this is real, but what I'm saying is if you listen to people who talk about being betas or get called betas, they're non-assertive communicators, right? So they're people who will like have lots of feelings but then like won't go and ask someone out. So I think, I know it sounds kind of weird, but I think a lot of like people like this, you don't have to go and take the red pill and become an ultra-chat or things like that. What you actually just need to do is be aware of what your internal emotional state is. And as you become more aware of your internal emotional state, you can start to be more assertive in communication. And this is where if you look at some of it like this community, right, they're all about assertive communication. I think sometimes their assertiveness crosses the bridge into toxicity and being harmful. But I think that like this is the kind of interesting thing about that community is I think they've stumbled on a lot of good stuff, but I think their underlying mechanisms are not scientifically based. Because what you actually discover is that as you become less\\n- who are not aware of their emotions Can't manage them. So this is where like, here's the tricky thing. So if I'm not aware that my negative emotions are building up, how am I supposed to healthily cope with them? right? Because the goal of overcoming an addiction is you have to develop healthy coping mechanisms. Fantastic. Let's develop healthy coping mechanisms. Let's meditate. But if I'm not even aware that I'm feeling anxious, like I'm not even going to bother  feeling anxious, like I'm not even gonna bother to meditate. Does that make sense? So in order to develop healthy coping mechanisms, we have to know when we need to cope in a healthy manner. And if we're a lexatimic, we don't even realize it. So let's move on. Now we get into some real problems. So here's what we tend to find in people who are lexithymic and what their relationships look like. Oftentimes, they are cold and distant when it comes to communication. So in their relationships, they like feel distant. So this is what we would call emotional unavailability. I'm looking for someone who's emotionally available. That's someone who is not cold and distant. Let's think about what the opposite is, right? So warm and present. This equals emotional availability. And I want you all to think a little bit about, okay, if you're cold and distant in a relationship, think about your parents, right? Were their, your parents warm and present or were they cold and distant? A second feature, if you look at the science of Alexathymia and look at, if you take people who are Alexithymic and look at what else at what other communication patterns do you see? The other thing, you're all going to love this, social, non-assertive communication. So sometimes this is social anxiety or we call this social anxiety. I'm not saying that they have a social anxiety disorder. What I'm saying is that people who are socially non-assertive with communication have difficulty walking up to someone and initiating a conversation.

What you actually just need to do is be aware of what your internal\\n- specifically is because of something within yourself, right? So let's kind of look at it seems like everyone I meet is a functioning alcoholic and wastes their money. Peer pressure led me to going through an alcoholic phase of my own and I was throwing money away. Does that sound like anyone we know? Right? And this is also like, I also say it in kind of a meme sense, but let's be clear, this is almost a survival mechanism because if you are, if this has happened to you, what is the lesson that your brain is going to learn. Steer clear of functional alcoholics who waste their money, right? Because you got pulled into this once before, it's actually very logical. But at the same time, you've got to be very logical. But at the same time, you've got to be very careful, because if you're rejecting a class of people, which is exactly what you yourself suffered from, then you've got to be kind of careful from that, right? Because a lot of that rejection is then, so people will talk about things like projection or displacement or reaction formation. So what do these things mean? So projection is when, you know, if I'm cheating on my spouse, I will be paranoid and I will like be like thinking like, you're cheating on me, aren't you? You're cheating on me, aren't you? It's like actually coming from me, but I project it out onto other people. The other thing that could happen is displacement, where I'm truly angry with myself for falling for this crap, but I'm taking the anger that I have towards myself and I am displacing it onto other people. Like those function alcoholics, those dumb asses, they're such terrible people. And then reaction formation is somewhat similar, so like the best example that I have a reaction formation is the homophobic homosexual. So some people grow up in a particular environment where they are taught to hate something or they're taught about homosexuality and how homosexuality is bad and they themselves are homosexual. And so the only way they\\n- this defense mechanism of, I'm a reject you before you reject me. What else is going on? When you're lonely and judgmental, option number two on the differential diagnosis is we hate in others that which we cannot fix in ourselves. Key, key, key. If you find yourself rejecting a particular class of people, there's a decent chance that the reason you reject them in the vein of screw you specifically is because of something within yourself, right? So let's kind of look at it seems like everyone I meet is a functioning alcoholic and wastes their money. Peer pressure led me to going through an alcoholic phase of my own and I was throwing money away. Does that sound like anyone we know? Right? And this is also like, I also say it in kind of a meme sense, but let's be clear, this is almost a survival mechanism because if you are, if this has happened to you, what is the lesson that your brain is going to learn.

So some people grow up in a particular environment where they are taught to hate something or they're taught about homosexuality and how homosexuality is bad and they themselves are homosexual. And so the only way they can like manage those feelings is to lash out against other homosexuals. Right? So we hate in others that which we cannot fix in ourselves. So that could be going on here too. Okay. So the next thing is, if you're having trouble engaging in relationships, if you're lonely, so what we hear in this post is what this person wants, right? Like this is where I want to meet people but no one is interested or they want to do things where they pretend to be smart but are riddled with logical fallacies.

Really common problem? Excellent question. What do you do about it? And this is where it's kind of interesting, but the short answer is it sort of doesn't matter, right? So like, I know it sounds kind of weird, but whether you have a diagnostic reason for being the way that you are, or you are lazy, you still have the same shared problem, which is that you're unable to do things. That problem needs to be fixed. Whether you have ADHD or you're lazy, like that's sort of in a weird way, it's almost irrelevant. It does become relevant because ADHD may open up additional ways to fix it. So I'm not saying it's truly irrelevant, but what I'm saying is that the situation is what it is. The ADHD is just a label that you put upon it, right? It may give you some amount of tools, it may give you some amount of options, but this is where I'd say that, you know, if there are tools to organize yourself with ADHD, they may help you even if you're lazy. So this is where, you know, your situation is what it is, irrespective of what label someone will give you. And so there are things that you can do irrespective of what label you have. So what is the nature and experience of your inability to work? Ask yourself that question. That question is the same whether you have ADHD or don't have ADHD. And then you ask yourself, okay, so like what is like what is it that makes it hard for me to work? Is it, is it, I feel unmotivated. What does that mean? What does unmotivation mean? Like, what does that mean to feel unmotivated? Is it that your mind is distracted? Is it that mean to feel unmotivated? Is it that your mind is distracted? Is it that you're afraid of the consequences? Is it that when you start to work, like you you automatically compare yourself to other people and you think there's no point in studying because this person is going to do a and you think there's no point in studying because this person is going to do a better job than I am. There\\n- development of your brain? The short answer is we don't know. So I'd say like steer clear that stuff, especially if you're like a teenager or even your earlier, early 20s. So one person saying, how do I deal with the imposter syndrome of whether I might actually have ADHD or I'm just normal and lazy, especially since the waiting list for formal assessment is so long here. So if you're stuck between trying to figure out, am I lazy or do I have ADHD? Really common problem? Excellent question. What do you do about it? And this is where it's kind of interesting, but the short answer is it sort of doesn't matter, right? So like, I know it sounds kind of weird, but whether you have a diagnostic reason for being the way that you are, or you are lazy, you still have the same shared problem, which is that you're unable to do things.

There are all kinds of things that can impact your motivation. And so you have to understand the nature of your experience. You're going to get more answers studying yourself than you will from like getting a particular label and finding external answers. And that may sound weird, you're like, but wait, if I have ADHD, doesn't that mean that there are all these solutions out there? News Flash is someone who treats people with ADHD, they're all on the struggle bus anyway. It certainly can help and there can be transformative, you know, interventions that you can do for ADHD. I'm\\n- and execute tasks. So for example, if I want to like study for a test there are many things that go into studying for a test and one of the key things that I have to do when studying for a test first of all is behavioral inhibition. So I sit down to do when studying for a test, first of all, is behavioral inhibition. So I sit down to study for a test, and in order to study for the test, I have to stop myself from like doing other things, like pulling out my phone, you know, logging on to Reddit, like watching Twitch, playing video games, like going to get a snack. So there's a part of my brain that when I focus it in one direction like prevents me from doing all the other things. I may have impulses to do those things, but essentially my brain is like, no, we're not going to do that now. Like, we'll check the phone later. So the first thing that happens in people with ADHD is that they have deficiencies and their behavioral inhibition circuitry. That kind of comes from the frontal lobe, okay, we'll talk about that in a second. The second thing is that people with ADHD have altered sensitivity to reinforcement. And so what that means is that things that are low-hanging fruit and easily enjoyable are far much more enjoyable to people with ADHD. So if you look at like delayed gratification studies and people with ADHD, where you ask someone with ADHD, Hey, I'll give you a dollar now or I'll give you five dollars and five minutes. Which one do you want? Literally the brain of someone in ADHD $5.5 in five minutes, which one do you want? Literally the brain of someone in ADHD is going to pick the dollar now as opposed to the dollar and five dollars and five minutes. So compared to the neurotypical brain, the sensitivity to reward and reinforcement is altered in ADHD. The third thing that that happens in ADHD is a high amount of impulsivity. So people may say like is decreased inhibition the same as impulsivity and it turns out that neuroscientificly they're actually like\\n- interview about ADHD. But I do think that it's, you know, ADHD has advantages. Like, what's it crosses the threshold of disorder? It's, the reason we define it as a disorder is like because it's negatively impacts your function. So if you've got super bad, you know, ADHD, chances are, it's just like, it's a negative, right? But that's why I also prefer to sort of use the Irovetics system because I am quite ADHD, but I'm like subclinical. So I think Vata is a better example of like how to understand the spectrum, the bell curve of like attention across human beings. Is becoming apathetic to your successes whilst obsessing over your failure is common with ADHD? I'm going to say yes. So let's go back to the neuroscience. So remember that... Oh man, this is so complicated. Let me just think about this. Okay. So the question is, is becoming apathetic to your successes whilst obsessing over your failure is common with ADHD? And I'm going to say yes. So let's lean a little bit on what we've learned today, okay? And maybe y'all can walk through this with me. So first thing is obsessing over your failures common with ADHD. Let's unpack that phrase. So the first thing is obsessing. So one of the hallmarks of ADHD is disregulated attention. So a lot of times people assume that ADHD means a very small attention span. But the truth is, if you talk to people with ADHD, what you find is disregulated attention. And what that means is that sometimes their attention is very, very small, but the flip is also true where sometimes they get so deeply absorbed in something where like everything around them ceases to exist. So this is a disorder of attention. Instead of your attention staying kind of in the middle, where you can get distracted when you need to get distracted, but you can focus when you need to focus. What you'll see oftentimes in ADHD is a hyper focus to the impairment of their life. So I get so caught up in a video game that I lose all track of time. I get so obsessive\"}]\n",

So let's kind of look at it seems like everyone I meet is a functioning alcoholic and wastes their money. Peer pressure led me to going through an alcoholic phase of my own and I was throwing money away. Does that sound like anyone we know? Right? And this is also like, I also say it in kind of a meme sense, but let's be clear, this is almost a survival mechanism because if you are, if this has happened to you, what is the lesson that your brain is going to learn. Steer clear of functional alcoholics who waste their money, right? Because you got pulled into this once before, it's actually very logical. But at the same time, you've got to be very logical. But at the same time, you've got to be very careful, because if you're rejecting a class of people, which is exactly what you yourself suffered from, then you've got to be kind of careful from that, right? Because a lot of that rejection is then, so people will talk about things like projection or displacement or reaction formation. So what do these things mean? So projection is when, you know, if I'm cheating on my spouse, I will be paranoid and I will like be like thinking like, you're cheating on me, aren't you? You're cheating on me, aren't you? It's like actually coming from me, but I project it out onto other people. The other thing that could happen is displacement, where I'm truly angry with myself for falling for this crap, but I'm taking the anger that I have towards myself and I am displacing it onto other people. Like those function alcoholics, those dumb asses, they're such terrible people. And then reaction formation is somewhat similar, so like the best example that I have a reaction formation is the homophobic homosexual. So some people grow up in a particular environment where they are taught to hate something or they're taught about homosexuality and how homosexuality is bad and they themselves are homosexual. And so the only way they\\n- to intense negative emotions and you are in an invalidating environment, what that sort of does is like, then when those negative emotions arise, like they get amplified and they don't get toned down by your environment. So what this also means is that if you have a neurotypical brain in an invalidating environment, but if you aren't neurologically sensitive to that negative emotion, even if the environment is somewhat invalidating, it's not that big of a deal because your brain is able to sort of like regulate its own emotions internally. So this is why there's a correlation with trauma, but what we tend to see is that some people with BPD don't grow up in necessarily traumatic households. Some of them will really grow up in invalidating environments. And then you'll have like invalidating environments. Let's say your mom is invalidating, but you've got three kids in the household. And only one of them will grow up with BPD, even though they all have the same invalidating an environment. When what's the reason for that is because the other two kids have brains that are not sort of like have an itchy trigger finger when it comes to negative emotion. So I really like this theory. I think it's very explanatory where there's a neurological vulnerability plus an environmental factor. So a key thing that people sort of think about, especially when we talk about personality disorders, is does this mean I'm screwed? Because this is a personality disorder, right? You're telling me Dr. K, that my brain is busting. I have a small amygdala and like if I've got a small amygdala and I don't know who I am on the inside does that mean I'm essentially screwed because I engage in all these manipulative behaviors and I'm screwed I'm screwed I'm screwed, I'm screwed. The answer is actually shockingly, no. Actually, BPD is, I know it sounds kind of bizarre, but actually has one of the best prognoses of personality disorders. So the first thing to understand is that there are very good\\n- And so there may be people with like 25% risk or 75% risk. And so depending on like, you know, what the other traumatic experiences, let's say this is like you're in the Holocaust, so then you end up with PTSD. And let's say even this person is like, you know, had a mom who never gave them like no bedtime stories. And this can result in PTSD. So you guys see like basically genetics doesn't determine is not like it's not a destiny. It's a vulnerability that combined with a particular experience can result in the manifestation of an illness. So like the other way that I kind of think about this just to use a quick analogy is I kind of think about like the genetic vulnerability as like a seed. Okay, so like genetics is like a seed. And then depending on what kind of soil you plant the seed in, and this is where the experience is like the soil. Depending on what kind of soil you plant the seed and it can result in a plant or not a plant, right? So if like if my soil is like concrete and I take this seed and I try to plant it in concrete, it's never going to grow. So like a concrete soil is sort of like what I think of is like let's say a monk, right? Because they're so control of their mind, they're in such strong control of their mind that like even genetic vulnerabilities can be kind of like overcome. Compared to if I take you know even a seed that's not very robust and not very healthy and I plant it in super fertile soil like growing up in an environment where you have parents that are like abusive and emotionally neglectful, even the, you know, the weakest seed when grown in the most fertile soil will manifest in a plant. And so then people are saying, well, okay, like I know what the next, you know, point of hopelessness is. Oh, I have a genetic vulnerability. I have a family history of like whatever, and I grew up in an unhealthy environment Does that mean that I'm basically screwed? And the answer is still no because remember that through experiences You can actually change the soil, right? So this continues to be malleable. So even if you have genetic vulnerabilities to particular things, by changing your environment, by changing your relationships, you can still escape the destiny that negative genetics will offer you. Does that make sense, chat? We understand that? So going back to ADHD, so there does seem to be in depression, there does seem to be a strong genetic concordance between ADHD and depression, if you drew the short end of the stick or if you drew the short end of the stick, or if you drew the short straw, sorry, doesn't mean you're screwed. A couple of other things to note about the genetics and sort of correlation between between ADHD and depression. So this is quite alarming. So ADHD increases your risk of depression by fivefold. Okay? So it's like an increased risk. It's crazy by fivefold. So you're five, if you take a group of, you take a kids, and 50 of them have ADHD, and 50 of them have no ADHD, the likelihood of\\n- the studies about things like PTSD being passed down to children through epigenetics? Yeah I'm pretty familiar with that research so let's take the question from the top. So there's some evidence, okay, let's just really go from the top. So the first thing is that there's a field called epigenetics, which is not the actual genes, but the act how genes are turned on or turned off. So our genome, look, we've got a bunch of stuff in there, and it's not necessarily the allele or like the gene, like the DNA sequence at a particular point, but like you can turn genes on and you can turn genes off. That's called epigenetics. So whether genes are turned on or off actually relates to our experiences. So certain kinds of genes will be turned on by certain kinds of experiences. So an example of this is when our body gets an infection, we will activate transcription, we will turn on genes of things like heat shock proteins and other kinds of like genes in our cells that will help us fight infection. Right? So it's like there's a bunch of stuff that like once we get infected, our body's like time to go to war, let's start producing, like let's turn on our armories and start producing soldiers and like, you know, cytokines that will help us fight infection. So experiences can affect our genetic activation. And so if we go back to what I was saying earlier, about what is the model of genes, right? So that's where I sort of shared that genetics plus vulnerability is what results in illness. And all that kind of stuff is epigenetic. So this is also where when we kind of look at that developmental aspect, when we were talking about, okay, if you have a kid with ADHD who grows up with an ADHD brain and experiences life as a kid with ADHD with bullying and not having friends and like poor academic success, that's gonna have an epigenetic impact and make you vulnerable to depression. So I believe a lot of that stuff is mediated through epigenetics. I personally have not looked into the\"}]\n",

So check out our video on Alexathymia if you all want to. And then you can even tell your therapist that, hey, I'm concerned that I'm a little bit of lexathimic. So you're signaling to them that you may not be able to participate in therapy in a default way. The next thing that you can do is ask your therapist to change their style a little bit if it isn't working for you. So you can tell them, hey, I've noticed that you're really quiet and then you kind of ask these questions like how do you feel over and over and over again? And then I keep answering I don't know. Can you try to be a little bit more active or offer a little bit more guidance instead of being quieter and asking only open-ended questions. Can you help me understand stuff or guide me in some way? And some therapists may feel really uncomfortable with that. They may turn that around into a question. Why do you feel like you need more guidance? I don't know, because this doesn't seem to be helping very much. So you can just ask them to change their style a little bit. And the third thing that you can do if number one and number two don't work is after two or three sessions I would just go to them and say, hey, I don't feel like I'm actually getting a whole lot out of this therapy. So you seem to be asking certain questions that I have difficulty answering and I'm hoping that you can recommend a different therapist Who's a little bit more active can offer a little bit more guidance or asks questions in a way that can help me understand my emotions better. And I know that this sounds mortifying, oh my God, as a dude, why would I ever do that? As anyone, as any patient, why would I ask to see a different therapist? It means that I don't think they're good. And it doesn't mean that they're not good. It just means that they're not really helping you very much. Or at the minimum, you can have a conversation about what's working and what isn't, and then hopefully y'all can work through that stuff. So I as a therapist actually don't feel, I mean, I feel bad in some ways, but I'm really grateful for all of my patients who have come to me and said, hey, Dr. K, this is not working. Because then one of two things happen. One is either we work on it, and then we actually make a breakthrough of some kind and now we're really jiving together, or I recommend that the person go see someone else. And what's my duty as a doctor or someone's duty as a therapist? It's to help the person, not help the person myself. It means giving that person whatever kind of help they need. So oddly enough, I'm still recommending that y'all try psychotherapy, because it is still an evidence-based, very effective approach. The other thing to consider, though, is that a lot of emotions live in our body, and as men, sometimes we need to do more bodily stuff. So there are studies that show that Tai Chi and yoga, for example, are effective treatments for a lot of things like mood disorders or\\n- for you. So you can tell them, hey, I've noticed that you're really quiet and then you kind of ask these questions like how do you feel over and over and over again? And then I keep answering I don't know.

Because then one of two things happen. One is either we work on it, and then we actually make a breakthrough of some kind and now we're really jiving together, or I recommend that the person go\\n- psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who then asked me a question, if a patient walks into your office and says, doctor, can you help me find a girlfriend or boyfriend? What are you supposed to say? And my dumb ass is like, yes, this is what we do in therapy. We help people accomplish their goals. And it turns out that I was wrong. And that in therapy, we do not help people accomplish their goals. The right thing to say, when someone walks in and says, hey, can you help me find a girlfriend? The right thing to say is not to say anything, not to answer the question, because heaven forbid, as a psychiatrist, you answer a patient's question. Instead, you have to turn it into a question. Invite curiosity, what is it that makes you want a girlfriend? How do you feel about not having a girlfriend? Why do you think it is that you haven't been able to find a girlfriend? What's going on? Tell me about your feelings. Let's talk. Let's talk some more, let's talk some even more. And this is what I found incredibly frustrating as a therapist, is that we're a profession of people who don't really focus on the outcomes of our patients. I know it sounds kind of paradoxical, and if you're a therapist out there and you take offense to that, there's a good reason that you will, and we'll get to that in a second. But if we sort of look at the profession, we're a profession that will do therapy with people for 20 years and we'll keep on talking about feelings, talking about feelings, talking about feelings, and then like it's not clear to me what the patient gets out of that. And so there are a couple of things that we have to say kind of in defensive therapy because it's not all bad and it's actually really good. The first is if this is so bad like why does everyone focus on self-love and self-compassion? And this is what's really important to understand. Is that for about half of patience, the single most revolutionary thing you can do for them is to teach them self-love. So I think\\n- when I help them see that, you're actually totally fine as a human being. It is this behavior that you need to change. And what I tend to find with my patients is when they start to realize this, not only do they feel better, right, because now I'm not a POS over here, and they can take corrective action. And this is what taking responsibility means. So you can take corrective action, and then as these problems start getting better, their relationships start improving, their performance starts proving, everything gets better, and they feel better, because they don't feel like a POS because they recognize that the problem is outside of myself. If the problem is outside of myself, there is a clearer way to fix it. So how do we go about doing that? So literally what I want you all to do is to any time you take something personally, I want you to try to remove yourself from the equation. Try to try to remove yourself from the equation. So try to practice a little bit of empathy. Put yourself in the other person's shoes and ask yourself, what do they actually see? What is the behavior? What is the behavior? What are the words? What is the visible expression? It is not identity, right? Because they have no sense of like who your identity is. Like, that's not a thing that they can see. There are going to be certain thingthing that they can see. There are going to be certain things that you are doing saying certain ways that you're acting that the other person is going to perceive. So the first thing that you need to do is look through the eyes of the other person, which by the way is the exact deficit that narcissists have, right? So even if we look at evidence-based treatment for narcissism, one of the treatments is something called mentalization-based therapy. And in mentalization-based therapy, literally what we're training these people to do is see things through other people's eyes. So ask yourself if you get something that makes you feel bad and you're taking it\"}]\n",

What are you going to do about it? So this is the really important thing that we sort of discover from the do about it. So this is the really important thing that we sort of discover from the psychology of military recruits, is that negatively expressing stuff is OK as long as there is faith underneath that like you will make it in the end. And what we actually discover is that what boot camp does to people is it improves the psychological concept called grit. And grit is the very opposite of like all this self-love and self-compassion stuff. So in 2007, there was a psychologist named Angela Duxworth who discovered this concept called grit, which is sort of like this personality characteristic, which is like people don't give up. It's not self-love, it's not self-compassion, it's not like, it's related toto resilience actually is the closest thing But she basically noticed that some people like quit when things go bad and other people like stick with it And if you really look at like boot camp, what does boot camp do? It boosts grit. Hey there, thanks for watching and I'm glad these videos have been helpful. A lot of times I'll read the comments and see people asking, well, what do I actually do about it? Which is a great question. And unfortunately the resources out there haven't been that great, which is precisely why I started HG in the first place. HG coaches are trained on a curriculum that integrates my understanding of what motivates us, what paralyzes us, and most importantly, what leads to lasting behavioral change. If you're ready to take the next step, HG coaches can help you build the life that you want. They've helped people build careers, help people find relationships, build networks of friends, and even do things like discover their passions or pursue hobbies. So if this sounds like something that you'd be interested in, check out the link in the description below. And so there's an alternative to going\\n- your strengths, your support structures. And that's why we have clinicians, at least so far, instead of robots. Why do we have clinicians? It's because it takes a human being to integrate all of this research and sort of apply it to you and sort of figure out, okay, for your individual situation, which are the research studies that are the most applicable? And so what I'd recommend to anyone out there who is, you know, concerned that they may have ADHD is I wouldn't default to believing that this is necessarily going to be an advantage. There's also a lot of like psychological stuff about, you know, like not wanting to believe that you are ill in some way, or coming to terms with the fact that if you do have an illness, like, that just sucks and it's a straight negative. And this is where, like, we want to believe, you know, that the world is an equal place. As a society, should we strive to make it equal? Absolutely. But, you know, as a medical doctor, like, I don't know if I believe that the world and the universe is an equal place. I mean, I've seen like kids, eight-year-olds diagnosed with cancer, and I don't think that like buying the childhood cancer flaw during character creation necessarily gives you like points elsewhere. Sometimes those kids happen to be poor. Sometimes those kids happen to have an abusive parent. And it's not like I really wish it was, I wish that every human being on the planet had the same pool of points for character creation. But the sad truth is that that's not how it is. And so some people really want to believe that like there's some silver lining to their experience. And there may be, I don't really know. But I think at the end of the day, what you've really got to do is if you're concerned about it, first of all, go see a licensed clinician, right? I talk a lot about the benefits of our coaching program, but this is not really appropriate for coaching. Go see a licensed clinician, someone who's actually trained in mental health\\n- involved with this, things like ego and stuff like that. We have other sources that we talk about the relationship of what activates the ego because taking things personally is a narcissistic defense mechanism. There's certain meditation techniques and things like that. Check out our videos on ego. We actually have a resource pack That's all about ego and confidence and then we also have things in things and stuff like Dr. Kaye's guide to meditation The trauma guide and then the last thing that is very, very helpful is when we have trouble seeing things the way that they are, this is really what our coaching program excels at. So the reason that their outcomes are so good is because they are very good at being an external lens for you, right? So if you're having trouble putting yourself in someone else's shoes or seeing what they see, that's exactly what a coach is for. They're there to look at things from the outside and share that information with you in an actionable way. So depending on what y'all are interested, check out more stuff. Thanks for making it to the end of the video and let us know if this actually makes sense to you or not. So is it you or is it me or does it work out or let us know? you\\n- to make myself feel a different way. On the flip side though, sometimes we actually want to use that. And this is where I got kind of curious about military recruits. And like, let's remember that military recruits will oftentimes join the military because they are unhappy with their lives and they're depressed and they're not going anywhere. And then after serving some period of time in the military, like sometimes there are cases of trauma and sexual assault and things like that. I've seen that working with veterans. But actually, I would say the majority of patients I work with really appreciate being in the military. They learned so much and they developed so much confidence. And what's going on there? How is it that the military can be so overtly abusive, right? You've got a drill sergeant who's telling you, hey, you suck. You're going to fail. And and yet you come out of that experience feeling stronger. Does a swift kick in the ass actually work? And if it works, what is the underlying psychological principle at play? So let's actually look at research on the psychology of people who go to boot camp. So there are a couple of really interesting aspects to it. The first is that while they are verbally abusive, which is bad, right, they actually are implicitly very, very, like, invested in you and don't give up on you. I think this paradox is really important to understand. So if you go to, if you actually join the military, there'll be drill sergeants and I went to a military school for a little while so I have a little bit of personal experience. Who will tell you that you're gonna fail out. You're pathetic, you're never gonna make it, you're never gonna make it, you're gonna fail, you're gonna fail, you're so pathetic. But they never kick you out, right? They sort of teach you one really important principle, which is that even though I'm telling you you're going to fail, I'm not actually going to kick you out, ever, ever. You can fail today and I'm going to\"}]\n",

            "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Given the context: \\'The retrieved context includes the following items:\\n- child. They\\'re not the right influence. My golden child. They\\'re not as good as you. This is conditioning. We can see it. Like this person even says like, you know, I want to help. Right? So he wants to help people. He wants to engage with people. I\\'m assuming it\\'s a he for a second. I don\\'t know why, but he or she wants to help people. Right? So this person wants to help people, right? So this person wants to help people, but like, what does their mind tell them? Like their mind is just incredibly, incredibly judgmental. So the first thing is that, you know, if we kind of think about like kids who grow up racist, like why are they racist is because of what they\\'ve been conditioned to be. The second thing here is that this person longs for connection. The main thing that they\\'re feeling is lonely. And when we start to feel lonely, it\\'s, that can manifest in all kinds of weird ways. And the loneliness can almost be a protective mechanism. So remember that the things that hurt us in life that are hard to kick are often doing something for us, otherwise we wouldn\\'t do them. So our brain is really, really good at figuring out like what\\'s a good deal and what\\'s a bad deal. And if you find yourself stuck in a situation where you\\'re torturing yourself or you feel like you\\'re lonely and you can\\'t make friends, like there\\'s something else going on underneath the surface. So the other thing to kind of point out is we say like, OK, the other reason that I kind of mentioned connection here is they talk about it as well. But what this person wants is, you know, I try to have deep philosophical discussions. That\\'s what this person really wants. So what they want is the discussion. So they\\'re not saying I want to read a book. They\\'re not interested in knowledge. Right? What they\\'re interested in is discussion. And they\\'re unable to find people who can engage in discussion. Like, for whatever reason, it just doesn\\'t seem to be, they seem to be kind of missing out on this. So there are a couple of things that are like really important here. The next is when we had this sort of system of enforced loneliness and we are judgmental, when we are lonely due to judgmentalness, what\\'s going on? A couple of things, okay? The first is that for people who have problems with self-esteem and wind up lonely, they sometimes will employ the defense mechanism of, I\\'m a reject you before you reject me. Okay? Okay, so I\\'m going to ask you all a question. What do you think what this person would do if they found someone who was able to engage in a deep philosophical discussion, let\\'s say that there was someone who was like a PhD student in philosophy who really knew what they were talking about. What do you think what happened? Would the person engage with them? Right? It\\'s interesting, right? So no one saying this person would be thrilled and be like, this is exactly what I\\'m looking for. So there could be a really interesting cognitive bias. The only people I see are like\\n- of these people who are very smart and put them out of context or maybe in context on places like the subreddit, I\\'m very smart, and I want to have deeply philosophical discussions. Everyone around me is impulsive. No one is working towards their goals. I feel very lonely. And how do we respond to this person? Generally speaking, no compassion. So on these places like the internet and in life, we say have compassion for all people, except people who think they\\'re smarter than everyone else. That\\'s the one thing that you can say that allows other people to treat you like crap, right? If you\\'ve been traumatized by someone else you deserve compassion. If your parents were narcissistic, you deserve compassion. But if you think you\\'re better than me, screw you. Let\\'s make fun of you. Let\\'s laugh at you. Right? That\\'s the one thing. It\\'s kind of interesting. So I really respect this person because this is a hard thing to say, right? It\\'s like hard to say. Even they\\'re very like, they\\'re self-reflective, they\\'ve done some good work, and I think it\\'s like, it\\'s amazing that already this person who is an I am very smart person on the rest of the internet would be treated like crap. But already in our community, they\\'ve become a little bit more self-reflective. They\\'ve started to realize like a little bit about what\\'s going on. And so being very smart or feeling like you\\'re really smart is incredibly isolating, right? And we hear this a lot. It\\'s hard for me to like meet people. Like even, and we make fun of people who think they\\'re smarter than everyone else because they\\'re like, you know, like everyone else like can\\'t debate philosophy and like quantum mechanics and philosophy and stoicism and whatever buzzword you want nowadays. Rick and Morty fans, perfect. So this experience, first of all, let\\'s start from the top, which is like what this person is first of all, let\\'s start from the top, which is like what this person is essentially talking about is like isolation, an\\n- like they\\'re smarter than everyone else are incredibly lonely. And like, I know that the internet loves to hate on people who think they\\'re smarter than everyone else, but the truth is like, they\\'re just as deserving of our compassion as anyone else, right? We\\'re just being judgmental. And there\\'s just one thing that we find particularly annoying. It\\'s like the I am very smart people and the Cairns. And so like, it\\'s just really hard to have compassion for some of these people. And at the same time, I think that this person has done an awesome job because as we get, as we start here and everyone\\'s like, screw this person. And then as we get down to the bottom, it\\'s like, yeah, you know, I mean no disrespect by the title. I don\\'t know how to better phrase my issue. They\\'re just being authentic, right? I want to say with friends, but I\\'m just, am I compromising my life? It\\'s really hard for me to meet people who I feel are productive and good influences, but I don\\'t know if I\\'m being a cocky assail. Like, this is an incredibly, like, humble, authentic representation of this person\\'s problem. This person is incredibly lonely. And so what do you do if you\\'re in this situation, where you genuinely feel like you cannot meet people who are giving you what you want, cannot challenge you, you don\\'t have mutual respect in a relationship, right? And this, by the way, so like, we\\'ll get to that in a second. So if you\\'re in this place, I\\'d start with sort of looking at your conditioning. Where were you taught to think like this? Because chances are there\\'s a lot of judgment in your past. Either in this case, you are like your mom literally told you, don\\'t hang out with that person, that person is stupid, is gonna hold you back. Or you are on the receiving end of the judgment, right? Or your mom called you stupid. And so you like learn to call other people stupid. We see this from this person\\'s dad too, where the dad doesn\\'t know how to form relationships. This person literally\\n- to do things where they pretend to be smart but are riddled with logical fallacies. I don\\'t think they pretend to be smart. I think they, you know, you just engage them in conversations, maybe they pretend to be smart, who knows, like maybe they\\'re insecure too. But if you want to have a relationship with someone and your problem is loneliness, a relationship is two ways. Right? A relationship goes both ways. So the question is, what do they want? This is where if you want to have a relationship, you may say like, okay, I don\\'t want those things. But like, okay, I don\\'t want those things. But like, no relationship is going to be exactly what you want, right? That\\'s not even a relationship. Like, maybe you\\'re looking for someone and this, maybe you\\'re looking for someone who wants the same things you want, which is possible. But I think there needs to be some kind of acknowledgement if you\\'re if you\\'re lonely about like what\\'s the other person\\'s perspective. Like what do they want from relationship? And is it impossible for you to engage with someone who doesn\\'t want what you want? Or can you engage with them anyway and maybe give them something that they want because maybe if they do that They\\'ll give you what you want, right? There\\'s like an exchange in relationships, which I\\'m not really getting much up. The interesting thing is that I think that this person does do this. So it\\'s kind of interesting because if you really talk about this example, like good friends with a co-worker at first we got along well They make impulsive decisions. I want to help them. So we see those elements there of like meeting people where they\\'re at Supporting them in their own challenges all these kinds of things, but then I think this conditioning and all this other crap gets in their own challenges, all these kinds of things. But then I think this conditioning and all this other crap gets in the way. So the right stuff is there, right? But there\\'s this weird kind of conditioning where he\\'s been taught to be judgmental or she\\'s been taught to be judgmental. And then they\\'re maybe afraid of being rejected and they may be like see negative parts of themselves and that other person which causes them push people away, right? And then we kind of get to the last thing, which is, we try to fix our internal problems by surrounding ourselves with the opposite. So this is kind of related to this point here. But if I am impulsive and, you know, like not disciplined and vulnerable to alcoholism, then I think I can fix that by surrounding myself with like PhD students, right? Who are like into philosophy. And there is some truth to this. So you want to be careful, like for example, if you\\'re trying to get sober, right, they\\'re like very powerful social capital and community effects. You don\\'t want to hang out with a bunch of people who are actively using if you\\'re trying to get sober. There\\'s a lot of like who are actively using if you\\'re trying to get sober. There\\'s a lot of\\', evaluate the truthfulness of the following claims. Score each claim on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means the claim is completely false or unsupported by the context, and 10 means the claim is entirely true and supported by the context. Ensure that the full range of scores is utilized, not just the two extremes, to prevent the scoring from being binary in nature. Make sure that any claim supported in the context should score over 5.Claims that are true but not supporrted by the context should score less than 5 but near to itInclude a rationale for each score to explain why the claim received that rating based on the facts presented in the context. Use the following JSON schema for your output: {\\n  \"$defs\": {\\n    \"Score\": {\\n      \"properties\": {\\n        \"string\": {\\n          \"title\": \"String\",\\n          \"type\": \"string\"\\n        },\\n        \"rationale\": {\\n          \"title\": \"Rationale\",\\n          \"type\": \"string\"\\n        },\\n        \"score\": {\\n          \"title\": \"Score\",\\n          \"type\": \"integer\"\\n        }\\n      },\\n      \"required\": [\\n        \"string\",\\n        \"rationale\",\\n        \"score\"\\n      ],\\n      \"title\": \"Score\",\\n      \"type\": \"object\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"properties\": {\\n    \"scores\": {\\n      \"items\": {\\n        \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/Score\"\\n      },\\n      \"title\": \"Scores\",\\n      \"type\": \"array\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"required\": [\\n    \"scores\"\\n  ],\\n  \"title\": \"ScoredOutput\",\\n  \"type\": \"object\"\\n}'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\\n  \"sentences\": [\\n    \"The question of why some people may struggle to recognize their own negative behaviors and motivations is a complex one.\",\\n    \"From the context, it appears that you\\'re referring to individuals who exhibit behaviors that can be perceived as \\\\\"bad\\\\\" or harmful towards others, yet they may not recognize or acknowledge the harm they\\'re causing.\",\\n    \"This phenomenon can be attributed to various psychological and social factors.\",\\n    \"One possible explanation is that these individuals may be conditioned to prioritize their own interests and needs over those of others.\",\\n    \"This conditioning can occur through various means, such as upbringing, social environment, or even genetics.\",\\n    \"As a result, they may develop a sense of entitlement or a lack of empathy, leading them to prioritize their own desires over the well-being of others.\",\\n    \"Another factor that might contribute to this phenomenon is the concept of cognitive dissonance.\",\\n    \"When an individual engages in behaviors that contradict their self-image or values, they may experience discomfort or dissonance.\",\\n    \"To alleviate this discomfort, they may rationalize or justify their actions, downplaying or denying the harm they\\'ve caused.\",\\n    \"Furthermore, it\\'s possible that these individuals may be driven by a deep-seated sense of loneliness or disconnection.\",\\n    \"They may be seeking validation or attention from others, but their methods of seeking it may be misguided or harmful.\",\\n    \"This could be due to a lack of empathy or understanding on their part, or even a result of their own past experiences and traumas.\",\\n    \"As for what could \\\\\"snap them out of it,\\\\\" it\\'s essential to recognize that individuals are complex and multifaceted.\",\\n    \"Changing one\\'s behavior and attitudes requires a deep understanding of oneself and the world around them.\",\\n    \"One potential approach could be to encourage these individuals to engage in self-reflection and introspection.\",\\n    \"This might involve exploring their motivations, values, and beliefs, as well as recognizing the impact of their actions on others.\",\\n    \"Additionally, exposure to diverse perspectives, empathetic listening, and constructive feedback can help individuals develop a more nuanced understanding of themselves and others.\",\\n    \"However, it\\'s crucial to acknowledge that these individuals may not be receptive to change or may require extensive therapy and support to overcome their negative behaviors.\",\\n    \"As a society, we must strive to create a culture that fosters empathy, compassion, and understanding, recognizing that everyone has the potential to grow and change.\",\\n    \"In summary, the phenomenon you\\'ve described is likely the result of a complex interplay between psychological, social, and environmental factors.\",\\n    \"While it\\'s challenging to \\\\\"snap\\\\\" individuals out of their negative behaviors, encouraging self-reflection, empathy, and understanding can be a crucial step towards positive change.\"\\n  ]\\n}'}]\n",

            "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Given the context: \\'The retrieved context includes the following items:\\n- things where there\\'s some kind of symptom, and we\\'ll talk about this in a second. There\\'s like some kind of symptom or like illness that like can\\'t be medically explained. So headaches are a good example of this. Brain fog is another good example of this. IBS or irritable bowel syndrome. Pots, postural, orthostatic, tachycardic syndrome is another good example of this. Various autoimmune conditions. Fibromyalgia, CPRS, sorry, CRPS, complex regional pain syndrome, like eczema, headaches, like these are all things that are psychosomatic in nature. And so what happens is when like when the mind suffers and has no coping mechanism or outlet for that suffering, it manifests in the body. Right? There\\'s even like physiologic evidence for this. We\\'ll go, if you guys want to hear about that, we\\'ll talk about that in a second. The mechanism through which these things happen. And so as the parent takes away the coping mechanism, you\\'re taking away the copium and punishing them more, right? Then this is conflict between like like mom and dad, and then the kid starts getting sick. I\\'ve seen this like a thousand times. And now the kid\\'s got the Trump card. The kid doesn\\'t want, it\\'s not about video games, the kid doesn\\'t want to go to school. The kid is afraid that he can\\'t go to school. The kid is maybe in love with someone that doesn\\'t like them back. Maybe he has ADHD and is struggling in school. Maybe he\\'s afraid that they\\'re going to be doomed. Maybe he\\'s afraid that they won\\'t get into good college. And they will be like judged by everyone around them. Maybe his kid is intimidated by everyone around them. Maybe his kid is intimidated, because he knows that older brother is a gamer and does extracurriculars and has big shoes to fill, and younger brother knows there\\'s no way I can ever live up to the shadow that my older brother has left. And so he\\'s like, oh, I need an excuse for my poor performance. So now I\\'m medically unable. I can\\'t do homework anymore. Headache. The kid is gonna win this game. This is something that the parents need to understand. The kids are gonna win. Hoo-hoo! They\\'re gonna win. It\\'s the parents need to understand. The kids are going to win. Who, who, they\\'re going to win. It\\'s the next thing that parents do is they send them off to like wilderness camps, right? It\\'s a combination of fixing and punishment. That\\'s what parents in the situation do. And so like it\\'s all about power dynamics. It\\'s not about collaboration or cooperation. It\\'s about I\\'m gonna force you to do what is best for you because I think it\\'s best for you. And this is where a toxic relationship comes from. Now kid doesn\\'t even want to go to dad\\'s place. Dad assumes it\\'s because I don\\'t let him watch TV. Well, like, what the hell do you expect him to do all day? Maybe it\\'s because mom expresses some degree of empathy. Maybe mom knows what it\\'s like to have chronic pain. Maybe there\\'s a reason why he doesn\\'t want to go to dad\\'s place. Like, ever consider that?\\n- development of your brain? The short answer is we don\\'t know. So I\\'d say like steer clear that stuff, especially if you\\'re like a teenager or even your earlier, early 20s. So one person saying, how do I deal with the imposter syndrome of whether I might actually have ADHD or I\\'m just normal and lazy, especially since the waiting list for formal assessment is so long here. So if you\\'re stuck between trying to figure out, am I lazy or do I have ADHD? Really common problem? Excellent question. What do you do about it? And this is where it\\'s kind of interesting, but the short answer is it sort of doesn\\'t matter, right? So like, I know it sounds kind of weird, but whether you have a diagnostic reason for being the way that you are, or you are lazy, you still have the same shared problem, which is that you\\'re unable to do things. That problem needs to be fixed. Whether you have ADHD or you\\'re lazy, like that\\'s sort of in a weird way, it\\'s almost irrelevant. It does become relevant because ADHD may open up additional ways to fix it. So I\\'m not saying it\\'s truly irrelevant, but what I\\'m saying is that the situation is what it is. The ADHD is just a label that you put upon it, right? It may give you some amount of tools, it may give you some amount of options, but this is where I\\'d say that, you know, if there are tools to organize yourself with ADHD, they may help you even if you\\'re lazy. So this is where, you know, your situation is what it is, irrespective of what label someone will give you. And so there are things that you can do irrespective of what label you have. So what is the nature and experience of your inability to work? Ask yourself that question. That question is the same whether you have ADHD or don\\'t have ADHD. And then you ask yourself, okay, so like what is like what is it that makes it hard for me to work? Is it, is it, I feel unmotivated. What does that mean? What does unmotivation mean? Like, what does that mean to feel unmotivated? Is it that your mind is distracted? Is it that mean to feel unmotivated? Is it that your mind is distracted? Is it that you\\'re afraid of the consequences? Is it that when you start to work, like you you automatically compare yourself to other people and you think there\\'s no point in studying because this person is going to do a and you think there\\'s no point in studying because this person is going to do a better job than I am. There are all kinds of things that can impact your motivation. And so you have to understand the nature of your experience. You\\'re going to get more answers studying yourself than you will from like getting a particular label and finding external answers. And that may sound weird, you\\'re like, but wait, if I have ADHD, doesn\\'t that mean that there are all these solutions out there? News Flash is someone who treats people with ADHD, they\\'re all on the struggle bus anyway. It certainly can help and there can be transformative, you know, interventions that you can do for ADHD. I\\'m\\n- we can actually intervene on. You guys get this? Okay, so now let\\'s try to understand how does ADHD early in life result in depression later in life? So remember that what we\\'ve if we kind of look at ADHD we have impulsivity in we have impulsivity, in attention, okay? Irritability, dopamine reward sensitivity, and And, yeah, poor emotional regulation. The other thing that we sort of know is that people with ADHD, their frontal lobes, mature more slowly. So what that means is like their maturity is going to be less than people of their age. So let\\'s kind of just think about this constellation of symptoms and what growing up as this person looks like or feels like. Okay? So the first thing is like, let\\'s talk about, you know, so now what I\\'m going to actually do is I didn\\'t do a great job of this, so let me actually think about doing it this way. What we\\'re going to do, we\\'re going to take these things. Okay, I\\'m going to move them over here. Um... No, screwed. Okay, let\\'s just, let\\'s take a look at these three. Now what we\\'re going to do is take these. Okay? And we\\'re going to see, we\\'re going to play a little game, chat. So these are the things that we know from, you know, studies contribute to the depression that people with ADHD have. So now let\\'s play a simple game, chat. Let\\'s see if these match up, right? So let\\'s say I\\'m impulsive. Do you think that will impact, how do you think that\\'ll affect my relationships? Am I more likely to have a discordant relationship if I\\'m impulsive? Right? Absolutely. Do you think I will more...my irritability, do you think that will negatively impact my relationships? Absolutely. Do you think my inability to attend the situations will negatively impact my relationships. Absolutely. So now we begin to see that, okay, if depression in ADHD is connected through discordant relationships, we can see how these three factors... connected through discordant relationships, we can see how these three factors will result in discordant relationships, right? So like I want you guys to put yourselves in the shoes of like a 13-year-old with ADHD. So let\\'s say I\\'m like hanging out with my friends and then like they\\'re all talking about something and then like my attention wanders I don\\'t participate in the conversation. So then like, you know, I\\'m just kind of sitting there. And then I\\'m impulsive, so I randomly start talking about like zebras. And if zebras, if there was a cheese named zebra cheese, what kind of stripes would it have? Would it be two kinds of cheeses blended together? And then all my friends, like, look at me like I\\'m a weirdo because I\\'m not able to attend to the conversation plus impulsivity and then what ends up happening so there are studies that show that basically people with ADHD get don\\'t participate in conversations in sort of a healthy way. They don\\'t get invited to social things amongst all kinds of other stuff. So we can see that like, and let\\'s not forget about irritability, like the fact that\\n- that studies show us show are correlated and serve as the link between ADHD and depression can absolutely be attributed to a developmental process because the child is here and then as the child grows without these being addressed, we end up with an adult who grew up with these experiences. And so now we can see how ADHD in childhood... childhood results in adult depression. You all see that? So this perfectly mirrors what the research tells us, which is that if you\\'re going this way, there\\'s a 50% chance, and if you\\'re going this way, if you start with depression, you\\'ve got a 2.7% chance. You all get that? Okay. So it does appear that there\\'s a causal link. So the cool thing is that if we can fix these in childhood, not just in childhood, but even in adulthood, what that means is that these things should get better. So as we become professionally more successful, as we engage in healthier relationships, because these problems are not just developmental, right? Because if you\\'re still inattentive and impulsive, like it\\'s going to be harder to engage in relationships. You may still be a social outcast in this day and age. The cool thing is that this is not set in stone. So if we fix this even in adulthood, our relationships will improve and we\\'ll see downstream effects. So now we get to the present. So this was sort of our development, right? And so now we\\'re up to bullet point five. Okay. Okay, and we\\'re going to talk a little bit about what this stuff results in. So there are further studies that sort of look at things like emotional regulation and the emotions of people with ADHD. These are the cross-sectional studies. So these studies are this conclusion that I\\'m drawing is developmental. So this is looking at the lifespan of children as they become adults. Now if we take a group of adults and we just kind of like look at them in this point in time and we try to figure out what is your experience of life in this moment with ADHD and depression. This is what we discover. That the link between ADHD and depression is primarily due to loneliness, primarily due to emotional regulation deficits and shame. So this is, I\\'m tacking this on. There\\'s not, I didn\\'t find a single paper about that. I\\'m sure it\\'s out there But this is just what I\\'ve seen so when we\\'re talking about You know what it\\'s like to sit with someone who has ADHD and depression. These are the three primary experiences which lead to depression in the present. Okay, now let\\'s try to understand where do these come from? So loneliness is kind of a no-brainer, right? We know that discordant relationships and bullying, like that\\'s going to lead to loneliness. And by the way, if we also look at correlations between suicidality, you guys remember our 3X risk of suicide, very, very highly correlated with loneliness. If we look at people who actually attempt suicide and commit suicide, they\\'re very lonely. So now we can even see where the big-scale epidemiologic data comes from, because\\', evaluate the truthfulness of the following claims. Score each claim on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means the claim is completely false or unsupported by the context, and 10 means the claim is entirely true and supported by the context. Ensure that the full range of scores is utilized, not just the two extremes, to prevent the scoring from being binary in nature. Make sure that any claim supported in the context should score over 5.Claims that are true but not supporrted by the context should score less than 5 but near to itInclude a rationale for each score to explain why the claim received that rating based on the facts presented in the context. Use the following JSON schema for your output: {\\n  \"$defs\": {\\n    \"Score\": {\\n      \"properties\": {\\n        \"string\": {\\n          \"title\": \"String\",\\n          \"type\": \"string\"\\n        },\\n        \"rationale\": {\\n          \"title\": \"Rationale\",\\n          \"type\": \"string\"\\n        },\\n        \"score\": {\\n          \"title\": \"Score\",\\n          \"type\": \"integer\"\\n        }\\n      },\\n      \"required\": [\\n        \"string\",\\n        \"rationale\",\\n        \"score\"\\n      ],\\n      \"title\": \"Score\",\\n      \"type\": \"object\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"properties\": {\\n    \"scores\": {\\n      \"items\": {\\n        \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/Score\"\\n      },\\n      \"title\": \"Scores\",\\n      \"type\": \"array\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"required\": [\\n    \"scores\"\\n  ],\\n  \"title\": \"ScoredOutput\",\\n  \"type\": \"object\"\\n}'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\\n  \"sentences\": [\\n    \"Based on the retrieved context, I\\'d like to provide some insights on what signs or symptoms might be observed in a child who experienced neglect in childhood and may be exhibiting similar patterns in adulthood.\",\\n    \"Given the complex and multifaceted nature of neglect, it\\'s essential to consider a range of potential signs and symptoms.\",\\n    \"Emotional regulation difficulties: Children who experienced neglect may have developed maladaptive coping mechanisms to manage their emotions, which can manifest as anxiety, irritability, or mood swings in adulthood.\",\\n    \"Attachment issues: Neglect can impact attachment styles, leading to difficulties in forming and maintaining healthy relationships.\",\\n    \"Adults who experienced childhood neglect may struggle with intimacy, trust, or emotional connection with others.\",\\n    \"Self-esteem and self-worth issues: Neglect can shape an individual\\'s self-perception, leading to low self-esteem, self-doubt, or self-blame.\",\\n    \"Adults who experienced childhood neglect may struggle with confidence, self-acceptance, or self-compassion.\",\\n    \"Trauma-related symptoms: Neglect can be traumatic, and adults who experienced it may exhibit symptoms such as hypervigilance, flashbacks, or nightmares, which can be triggered by environmental stimuli or internal cues.\",\\n    \"Dissociation: Neglect can lead to dissociation, which is a coping mechanism that involves disconnection from one\\'s thoughts, feelings, or memories.\",\\n    \"Adults who experienced childhood neglect may exhibit dissociative behaviors, such as depersonalization, derealization, or identity fragmentation.\",\\n    \"Substance abuse or addiction: Neglect can increase the risk of substance abuse or addiction in childhood and adulthood, as individuals may use substances as a coping mechanism for emotional pain or to self-medicate.\",\\n    \"Self-sabotaging behaviors: Neglect can shape an individual\\'s self-perception, leading to self-sabotaging behaviors, such as procrastination, self-doubt, or self-destructive tendencies.\",\\n    \"Difficulty with emotional expression: Neglect can lead to difficulties in expressing emotions, which can manifest as emotional numbness, flat affect, or difficulty articulating feelings.\",\\n    \"Trust issues: Neglect can erode trust in others, leading to difficulties in forming and maintaining healthy relationships in adulthood.\",\\n    \"Sensitivity to criticism: Neglect can increase sensitivity to criticism, which can lead to feelings of shame, guilt, or self-blame.\",\\n    \"It\\'s essential to note that these signs and symptoms can vary widely depending on the individual\\'s unique experiences and circumstances.\",\\n    \"Additionally, not everyone who experienced childhood neglect will exhibit these symptoms, and not everyone who exhibits these symptoms necessarily experienced childhood neglect.\",\\n    \"In conclusion, while it\\'s challenging to pinpoint specific signs or symptoms of childhood neglect in adulthood, it\\'s crucial to recognize that neglect can have a profound impact on an individual\\'s emotional, social, and cognitive development.\",\\n    \"By acknowledging these potential indicators and seeking support, individuals who experienced childhood neglect can work towards healing, growth, and recovery.\"\\n  ]\\n}'}]\n",

            "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Given the context: \\'The retrieved context includes the following items:\\n- I can do about that. This is who I am, right? This is who I am. It\\'s deterministic. It\\'s fatalistic and it\\'s exactly how narcissists talk. They never actually address their problems, which is why, so going back to the narcissist, right? If I have a problem behavior over here, right, like drinking, and someone says, this is the problem. But the narcissists places the blame over here. They take things personally. Then what that means is they never actually correct this. This continues again and again and again the behavior continues forever. So the more that they take things personally, the less they actually fix things in their life, which propagates the cycle and is what creates the life of a narcissist, which is that no one ever likes me, I don\\'t know what I can do differently, I\\'ve tried so hard, everyone hates me, and then they ignore their behaviors over and over and over again. So now what we can do with something super cool. We can use the blindness of a narcissism to shed light on our own lives. And when we take things personally, we are literally doing the same thing. Here is you and here is your behavior. personally, we are literally doing the same thing. Here is you and here is your behavior. And if you see the problem over here, instead of see the problem over here, because we as human beings are not good at seeing problems in two places. We tend to look at just one problem, right? Oh yeah, it\\'s not you. It\\'s me, or I\\'m the problem in the relationship, or you\\'re the problem in the relationship. Shared responsibility is scary and way more complicated. So what this does is when we see things over here, we do not see what is in here, and then we can\\'t take corrective action. So instead what we want to do, and this is what\\'s revolutionary for my patients, is when I help them see that, you\\'re actually totally fine as a human being. It is this behavior that you need to change. And what I tend to find with my patients is when they start to realize this, not\\n- being honest, that they are going through some stuff in their life right now where they\\'re not ready for a relationship, there really is nothing wrong with you. And then what happens is you feel bad, and the other problem is that there is no corrective action to take. See if you\\'re dating someone and they no longer want to be with you because of shit they\\'re that they\\'re going through, there\\'s nothing you can do to actually fix that. So there\\'s no corrective action, so there\\'s no improvement that you can make, but you feel bad, and then you will further rack your brain, thinking what is wrong, what is wrong, what is wrong, what do I need to fix, what do I need to fix, what do I need to fix. And this in turn leads to low self-esteem, which in turn leads to more narcissistic defense mechanisms. Right? There\\'s not actually anything to fix because the problem isn\\'t within you, but the moment that you take it personally, you beat yourself up, the problem is you, you don\\'t really know what to fix and this becomes a huge problem So what is the alternative? So this is what I work with with my patients, which is what we actually want to do is accept the appropriate responsibility. Let\\'s say that I go for an interview at Google, and there is some kind of leap code interview. So the skill is leap code. And then here is some prospective employer. I go to the interview and they say, sorry, you don\\'t get the job. Now, in this situation, I have two choices. I can take things personally. Oh my God, I knew I wasn\\'t cut out for this. I can take things personally. Oh my God, I knew I wasn\\'t cut out for this. I really suck at this. Like, oh my God, like you take it personally, right? The defect is within you. It is a part of your identity. It is an identity defect. And this is exactly how narcissists feel, by the way, right? So they feel like there isn\\'t... Oh no, it\\'s not... You just don\\'t like me. It\\'s not that you don\\'t like how I always steal your shit, or I\\'m always drunk, or I\\n- narcissists feel, by the way, right? So they feel like there isn\\'t... Oh no, it\\'s not... You just don\\'t like me. It\\'s not that you don\\'t like how I always steal your shit, or I\\'m always drunk, or I have no compassion for you, or I don\\'t listen to what you say, or how I prioritize all my needs above yours. It\\'s none of that stuff. You just dislike me. I can\\'t win. Right? Because what they see is they see the problem is over here, and I want you to think about this. If you are a shitty human, What is the solution to that? If the problem is in your identity, you cannot change your identity. It is not actionable information. So interestingly enough, if you go through It is not actionable information. So interestingly enough, if you go through an interview and you don\\'t get hired, and some people will take this personally. The defect is in here, but this is not actionable. So when I work with my patients, what I try to help them do is see what the actual defect is. Right? What we actually want to do is externalize the problem from ourselves. When we externalize the problem from ourselves, we open ourselves up to accepting responsibility. And we also create a path of action. The reason I didn\\'t get hired is not because I am a screwed-up human being. The reason I did not get hired, I know this is shocking, is because there is an insufficiency of the skills that I presented. And I want you all to think about that, right? That\\'s literally what not taking things personally is. It is not the problem isn\\'t me, it is there\\'s this thing that I need to work on. Even in the case of a breakup, right, If someone says, I need someone who\\'s more emotionally available. And if you\\'re not careful, you will take that personally. And you\\'ll be like, oh my God, how am I ever, like, there\\'s nothing I can do about that. This is who I am, right? This is who I am. It\\'s deterministic. It\\'s fatalistic and it\\'s exactly how narcissists talk. They never actually address their problems, which is why,\\n- think that that could help? May help your other relationships as well. So as you take this, as you take this approach, you\\'re going to start to isolate these kinds of things, and then you\\'re going to start working on them. This is what we mean by accepting responsibility. You\\'re going to start to fix those actions. And the beautiful thing is, as you start to fix those actions, you separate things from your ego. As you separate things from your ego. As you separate things from your ego and you start to take the right action, you remove bad feelings and bad outcomes. And if you stop and really think about it, right, so we\\'re going to end by talking about the narcissists. What is it that the narcissists never does? They never change their fucking behavior. They never change what they say. They keep on insisting that the problem is within them, but the whole reason that it\\'s so infuriating is because they do not focus on the things that are outside of them. And so if you want to take things less personally, it will help you so much. Practice a little bit of empathy, look at what other people are seeing. And you don\\'t get to answer what they\\'re seeing a loser. That is not something you can see, right? Even in the case of a loser, what is a loser? Maybe it\\'s someone who\\'s overweight, maybe it\\'s someone who doesn\\'t wear properly fit in clothing, maybe it\\'s someone who doesn\\'t groom themselves properly. Boom, action item number one, action item number two, action item number three. So literally look at things through other people\\'s eyes. Look at things, look at the manifestations of what you feel makes you take things personally, and then focus on those things. It\\'ll improve your life and it\\'ll prove the way that you feel. Last thing is that there are a couple of other things involved with this, things like ego and stuff like that. We have other sources that we talk about the relationship of what activates the ego because taking things personally is a narcissistic defense\\', evaluate the truthfulness of the following claims. Score each claim on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means the claim is completely false or unsupported by the context, and 10 means the claim is entirely true and supported by the context.

            "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Given the context: \\'The retrieved context includes the following items:\\n- And we\\'re going to talk a little bit about some myths around ADHD and some like tricky things about diagnosis. So the first thing to understand is that it is a disorder of attention Okay, so this is where a lot of people get tripped up. So disorders of attention, basically the way that I think about it, is an inability to control your attention. So this is, this, the lack of this understanding is why I think ADHD is the most over-diagnosed and the most under-diagnosed psychiatric diagnosis. And you may wonder how can something be over-diagnosed and under-diagnosed at the same time. The reason that you can have that is because you get a lot of people who don\\'t have the disorder that are getting a diagnosis and you are missing a lot of the people that do have a diagnosis, but you don\\'t catch it because of other things. So here are a couple of common misnomers about ADHD that people don\\'t get. The first is that people with ADHD can\\'t focus. This is actually incorrect. So with ADHD, we see a disorder of attention. So what we see with ADHD is actually hyper focus plus a lack of focus. So what is actually very common in people with ADHD is that they can sit and do one activity for four hours at a stretch provided it is the right activity So what you see is a disorder of attention where once an ADHD kid is doing something It is very very hard to get them to change gears. So once they almost have like an obsessive quality to their attention. Okay, so this is one of the reasons that it gets misdiagnosed because like parents will be sitting there with their kids and they\\'ll be like he never pays attention to school but once he starts playing with Legos like you have to physically pull him away like it is so hard to get his attention once they are doing something that they\\'re super into. So this sort of disruption of focus, or this like inability to control your attention, can result in hyperfocus. And it\\'s because parents or teachers or other people will see the hyperfocus, they\\'ll even see it with a particular subject. It\\'s like, my kid can\\'t pay attention in math, but like as long as it\\'s history, he can sit there and read books. Like you can give him like a history book at the age of seven and he\\'ll like read it for four hours at a time. So people with ADHD can absolutely hyperfocus on particular things. And in this situation it can also be like maladaptive because you can\\'t change your focus. You can\\'t stop studying history and start studying mathematics. Plus a lack of focus. So when it comes to mathematics, you have once again, like an inability to focus. So when I think about disordered attention, what I really, when I think about ADHD, I think about disordered attention. When I think about disordered attention, it is both a combination of hyperfocus and lack of focus. So the next thing to kind of think a little bit about is, let me just think for a second. Whether I want to say anything about this. Does this make sense to people? Okay. So the next\\n- is why I think ADHD is the most over-diagnosed and the most under-diagnosed psychiatric diagnosis. And you may wonder how can something be over-diagnosed and under-diagnosed at the same time. The reason that you can have that is because you get a lot of people who don\\'t have the disorder that are getting a diagnosis and you are missing a lot of the people that do have a diagnosis, but you don\\'t catch it because of other things. So here are a couple of common misnomers about ADHD that people don\\'t get. The first is that people with ADHD can\\'t focus. This is actually incorrect.

It\\'s like, my kid can\\'t pay attention in math, but like as long as it\\'s history, he can sit there and read books. Like you can give him like a history book at the age of seven and he\\'ll like read it for four hours at a time. So people with ADHD can absolutely hyperfocus on particular things. And in this situation it can also be like maladaptive\\n- things, that\\'s going to result in me being bullied. So if you talk to people who have ADHD, what you discover is they got bullied unless, you guys know this chat, unless they were a class clown. So like what people with ADHD essentially learn how to do is like the only way I can gain social standing is with my inattentiveness and my impulsivity, if I can make other kids laugh, I\\'m not going to be like bullied. But otherwise, they\\'re low social standing, their inability to pay attention makes them like get made fun of even more, right? The fact that they\\'re irritable means like you can get a rise out of an ADHD kid. And since I don\\'t have ADHD and I\\'ve got friends, I\\'ve got three or four of my friends. And I\\'m going to like surround the kid with ADHD and I\\'m gonna bully him. He\\'s gonna get pissed and he\\'s gonna throw a punch but the odds are stacked in my favor so he\\'s screwed. Right because he\\'s not gonna control himself and that\\'s why I\\'m gonna pick on him if\\'m a bully, because I know I can get a rise out of him. Okay, now let\\'s think about academic hardship. So, Impulsivity, does that lead to academic hardship? Yes. Inattention, does that lead to academic hardship? Yes, yes, yes. Okay? Once again, the problem here is that oftentimes ADHD is underdiagnosed in children. It is bizarre because it is the disease that is the most underdiagnosed disease and the most underdiagnosed and the most overdiagnosed disease, and the most underdiagnosed disease, in my experience. What that means is that a high number of people without ADHD get diagnosed with ADHD because they want Adderall, and they\\'re bored at school so they\\'re like have trouble with attention and someone gives them pills and it is the most underdiagnosed because a lot of times people will miss diagnoses of ADHD and because kids are smart. So the smarter you are, the more you can set up compensatory mechanisms and no one ever realizes you have ADHD. And does irritability lead to academic hardship? Probably, but\\n- They may be a hunter. And what we\\'re doing is we\\'re putting them in a classroom. We\\'re sticking them on a farm. And so this is where the disorder arises between within this gap. And this is what ADHD is. Now, this is where we have to go back for a second to our bell curve and acknowledge that like for a lot of people that I work with with ADHD, it\\'s about finding the right environment for them to thrive in, and then their illness no longer becomes a disorder. It can actually become a disadvantage, I mean, an advantage. But there are certainly people who have very disordered attention to where like, they, like really it is like, feels like a very serious like illness to me. But I would say that the majority of people that I work with with ADHD, even though it is an illness or a disorder or makes their life hard that I would say like two-thirds of them about 70% of them can function very well with their ADHD in the right circumstance and in fact it\\'s even advantageous. So there are some professions that we\\'ll talk about. So event planner is actually surprisingly one. Other examples are like Twitch Streamer, E-Sports Athlete. So there are actually a lot of professions, even working in the emergency room, can that are being a paramedic, being a plumber. There are several professions that, bizarrely enough, seem to like work totally fine with people with ADHD. And there are some situations where ADHD in having a dynamic mindset, because remember that the reason you\\'re getting diagnosed is because you\\'re unable to sit in a classroom for like seven hours a day, right? So like there are even some professions which are actually geared towards ADHD. And if you actually like go back and watch all of the interviews we\\'ve done with streamers, what you\\'ll find is that like a greater percentage of streamers compared to the normal population have ADHD, just based on their own self-report, right? Like so many people, like we\\'ll say like, oh yeah, I have ADHD. And it turns out that\\', evaluate the truthfulness of the following claims. Score each claim on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means the claim is completely false or unsupported by the context, and 10 means the claim is entirely true and supported by the context. Ensure that the full range of scores is utilized, not just the two extremes, to prevent the scoring from being binary in nature. Make sure that any claim supported in the context should score over 5.Claims that are true but not supporrted by the context should score less than 5 but near to itInclude a rationale for each score to explain why the claim received that rating based on the facts presented in the context.

Shared genetic predispositions: Both autism and ADHD are thought to have a strong genetic component, and research suggests that there may be shared genetic risk factors that contribute to the development of both conditions.\\n2. Brain structure and function: Studies have shown that individuals with autism and ADHD often have similar brain structure and function abnormalities, particularly in areas involved in attention, impulse control, and social cognition.\\n3. Sensory processing difficulties: Many individuals with autism experience sensory processing difficulties, which can lead to difficulties with attention and impulse control, which are common symptoms of ADHD.\\n4. Comorbidities: Both autism and ADHD can be comorbid with other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as intellectual disability, anxiety, and depression, which can also contribute to the co-occurrence of the two conditions.\\n\\nIt's essential to note that the relationship between autism and ADHD is complex and not fully understood. More research is needed to determine the underlying causes of the co-occurrence and to develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for individuals with both conditions.\\n\\nRegarding your question about whether it's possible to display stereotypically autistic behavior despite not having autism at all, the answer is yes. While autism is characterized by a unique set of symptoms, some of these symptoms can also be exhibited by individuals without autism due to various other factors such as neurological conditions, environmental factors, or even personality traits.\\n\\nFor example, an individual without autism may exhibit difficulties with socializing, strong habit formation, or unusual obsessions due to various reasons such as:\\n\\n* Neurological conditions: Certain neurological conditions, such as ADHD, Tourette's syndrome, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, can cause similar symptoms to autism.\\n* Environmental factors: Environmental factors, such as trauma, neglect, or sensory overload, can contribute to difficulties with socializing, habit formation, or obsession.\\n* Personality traits: Certain personality traits, such as introversion, perfectionism, or obsession, can also contribute to similar symptoms.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while autism is characterized by a unique set of symptoms, it's possible for individuals without autism to exhibit similar symptoms due to various other factors.\"}]\n",

            "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Given the context: \\'The retrieved context includes the following items:\\n- is in fact a symptom of this disorder. Hyperfocusing goes with autism. Perseveration goes with ADHD. There\\'s a little bit of a context there, which is he, I think he\\'s answering a question about the difference between perseveration and hyperfocusing, but I think he brings up a really excellent point. The challenge is that if you talk to people with ADHD, and I\\'ve certainly been in this camp, despite the fact that hyperfocusing is an attribute of a disorder, you\\'re going to have people who have this experience, right? Whatever you call it, this injury slash gift has been responsible for every single achievement in my life. And this is also why we have these kinds of memes, because the experience of people with ADHD is, for some of those people, the hyperfocusing seems to be an advantage. And as we sort of start to look a little bit at the research, you know, there\\'s some talk about neurodiversity, for example. So, like, there\\'s a growing movement within the mental health field that some of these things may not be shouldn\\'t it\\'s not appropriate to categorize them as illnesses but this is a situation of neurodiverse versus neurotypical. I have my reservations about some of these concepts which will kind of get to in a second, but you know there seems to be like some exploration of what we\\'ve traditionally thought of is mental illnesses and whether some of these mental illnesses can possibly have good effects. So we have some experts like Russell Barkley that say that this is hands-down kind of a the myth of hyperfocus is is in a sense false. This is a sign of like it\\'s it\\'s correlated with a frontal lobe injury which is absolutely correct. So there\\'s there\\'s a lot of you know useful stuff that he has to say but there are different perspectives. So this is a paper that was published in neuroscience and behavioral reviews that sort of examined creativity in ADHD and was sort of looking at, it was a review that looked at 31 studies and sort of like went over, you know, what is the relationship between ADHD and creativity? And essentially like, there\\'s a lot of like mixed stuff in here. I think a lot of the conclusions that they come to are somewhat questionable But there are a few interesting findings from from this study. So one is that most studies find evidence for increased divergent thinking for those with high ADHD scores, but not for those with the disorder, clinical. So what does this mean? So we\\'re going to unpack the statement a little bit. So divergent thinking is essentially correlated with like or that\\'s how they sort of describe or try to measure creativity. So when I sort of have a particular I\\'m faced with a particular problem, generally speaking, we tend to, you know, approach it a particular way and people who think divergently will be able to like draw on different kinds of perspectives or think about it in a non-standard way. So this is sometimes used in the literature as a correlation for creativity. And so one of the main\\n- injury, and it is perseverative responding. You should have stopped what you\\'re doing and you didn\\'t. There were other more important goals to have been accomplished and you ignored them. This is no gift. It is in fact a symptom of this disorder. Hyperfocusing goes with autism. Perseveration goes with ADHD. There\\'s a little bit of a context there, which is he, I think he\\'s answering a question about the difference between perseveration and hyperfocusing, but I think he brings up a really excellent point. The challenge is that if you talk to people with ADHD, and I\\'ve certainly been in this camp, despite the fact that hyperfocusing is an attribute of a disorder, you\\'re going to have people who have this experience, right?

This is a sign of like it\\'s it\\'s correlated with a frontal lobe injury which is absolutely correct. So there\\'s there\\'s a lot of you know useful stuff that he has to say but there are different perspectives. So this is a paper\\n- Irritability, once again, there are dietary changes here. So there is evidence that for example altering the diet of people with severe autism to have high iron diets and address nutritional deficiencies actually reduces the amount of like meltdowns that they have. I know it\\'s crazy, but people have actually done studies on severe autism and what they realize is that like, because some of these poor kids, like they\\'re just medicated through the roof to keep them like docile. And it turns out that they\\'re just medicated through the roof to keep them like docile. And it turns out that there are dietary changes that you can make that will actually alter your irritability. There\\'s a bunch of stuff about this in Dr. Kay\\'s guide, about sort of theories around how altering your diet affects neurotransmitter production, right, so produces serotonin, like gives you precursors that will be produced turned into dopamine, serotonin, etc., things like that. If your problem is shame or loneliness. So for shame, like maybe you need to go to therapy and this kind of therapy may be different. It\\'s more processing. Therapy, right? If you\\'re lonely, this is where like potentially coaching could come in like sure you could go to the therapy route and Talk about how you\\'re lonely, but maybe by working with a coach you can actually focus on solutions To make on solutions to make friends, right? Like how can I understand like okay where can I go? How do I meet people where how do I go outside? We had that post recently. So there are a lot of different solutions with loneliness that may not necessarily be sitting in your therapist\\'s office and like talking about how lonely you are. Like I know it\\'s crazy. As a therapist, sometimes I do not think that is the cured of loneliness. And now discordant relationships, this one is huge because once you are aware, right, so here\\'s my experience with the majority of people I work with with ADHD, when it comes to this, they have no idea what they\\'re\\n- things, that\\'s going to result in me being bullied. So if you talk to people who have ADHD, what you discover is they got bullied unless, you guys know this chat, unless they were a class clown. So like what people with ADHD essentially learn how to do is like the only way I can gain social standing is with my inattentiveness and my impulsivity, if I can make other kids laugh, I\\'m not going to be like bullied. But otherwise, they\\'re low social standing, their inability to pay attention makes them like get made fun of even more, right? The fact that they\\'re irritable means like you can get a rise out of an ADHD kid. And since I don\\'t have ADHD and I\\'ve got friends, I\\'ve got three or four of my friends. And I\\'m going to like surround the kid with ADHD and I\\'m gonna bully him. He\\'s gonna get pissed and he\\'s gonna throw a punch but the odds are stacked in my favor so he\\'s screwed. Right because he\\'s not gonna control himself and that\\'s why I\\'m gonna pick on him if\\'m a bully, because I know I can get a rise out of him. Okay, now let\\'s think about academic hardship. So, Impulsivity, does that lead to academic hardship? Yes. Inattention, does that lead to academic hardship? Yes, yes, yes. Okay? Once again, the problem here is that oftentimes ADHD is underdiagnosed in children. It is bizarre because it is the disease that is the most underdiagnosed disease and the most underdiagnosed and the most overdiagnosed disease, and the most underdiagnosed disease, in my experience. What that means is that a high number of people without ADHD get diagnosed with ADHD because they want Adderall, and they\\'re bored at school so they\\'re like have trouble with attention and someone gives them pills and it is the most underdiagnosed because a lot of times people will miss diagnoses of ADHD and because kids are smart. So the smarter you are, the more you can set up compensatory mechanisms and no one ever realizes you have ADHD. And does irritability lead to academic hardship? Probably, but\\', evaluate the truthfulness of the following claims. Score each claim on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means the claim is completely false or unsupported by the context, and 10 means the claim is entirely true and supported by the context. Ensure that the full range of scores is utilized, not just the two extremes, to prevent the scoring from being binary in nature. Make sure that any claim supported in the context should score over 5.Claims that are true but not supporrted by the context should score less than 5 but near to itInclude a rationale for each score to explain why the claim received that rating based on the facts presented in the context.

            "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Given the context: \\'The retrieved context includes the following items:\\n- a drinking problem or whatever. So I\\'ll like validate them for a while. I\\'ll talk to them about wow, that sounds genuinely very difficult and it sounds like you really love this person. And at the same time, like, they can really turn into a real monster when they\\'ve been drinking like that must be so hard for you so we as psychiatrists is why we do this right so we actually like speed up the venting process through validation. So we\\'re like, let\\'s get this shit moving. Okay, I\\'m gonna tell you why your life is so hard. I\\'m gonna validate, validate, validate. And then 100 minutes of venting turns into 30 minutes of venting. And then is the psychiatrist where I do as I say, okay, now we\\'re, what are we gonna do about it, right? So what we do, the reason we encourage venting and the reason we use validation is to speed it up, is to decompress that emotion so you can take appropriate action. The problem with venting is that it\\'s a form of emotion-focused coping. And the problem with emotion-focused coping is that over time, it doesn\\'t actually lead to good things. So let\\'s take a quick look at venting and understand what it is and how it works. So venting is a form of something called emotion-focused coping. And here\\'s what we know about emotion-focused coping. So this is from a paper about maladaptive coping mechanisms developing in childhood. So children facing chronic and uncontrollable stress, less often cope by actively attempting to solve problems and managing their emotions. So in fact, active attempts to intervene in uncontrollably stressful situations lead to undesirable social outcomes. So what does this mean? This means that when you\\'re a child growing up, if you try to fix a problem like your parents are fighting and they\\'re gonna get divorced, it doesn\\'t end well. Instead, what children learn how to do is manage stress through acceptance. They don\\'t tend to do a whole lot of cognitive reframing, but they tend to focus on their emotions, right? So I can\\'t\\n- to intense negative emotions and you are in an invalidating environment, what that sort of does is like, then when those negative emotions arise, like they get amplified and they don\\'t get toned down by your environment. So what this also means is that if you have a neurotypical brain in an invalidating environment, but if you aren\\'t neurologically sensitive to that negative emotion, even if the environment is somewhat invalidating, it\\'s not that big of a deal because your brain is able to sort of like regulate its own emotions internally. So this is why there\\'s a correlation with trauma, but what we tend to see is that some people with BPD don\\'t grow up in necessarily traumatic households. Some of them will really grow up in invalidating environments. And then you\\'ll have like invalidating environments. Let\\'s say your mom is invalidating, but you\\'ve got three kids in the household. And only one of them will grow up with BPD, even though they all have the same invalidating an environment. When what\\'s the reason for that is because the other two kids have brains that are not sort of like have an itchy trigger finger when it comes to negative emotion. So I really like this theory. I think it\\'s very explanatory where there\\'s a neurological vulnerability plus an environmental factor. So a key thing that people sort of think about, especially when we talk about personality disorders, is does this mean I\\'m screwed? Because this is a personality disorder, right? You\\'re telling me Dr. K, that my brain is busting. I have a small amygdala and like if I\\'ve got a small amygdala and I don\\'t know who I am on the inside does that mean I\\'m essentially screwed because I engage in all these manipulative behaviors and I\\'m screwed I\\'m screwed I\\'m screwed, I\\'m screwed. The answer is actually shockingly, no. Actually, BPD is, I know it sounds kind of bizarre, but actually has one of the best prognoses of personality disorders. So the first thing to understand is that there are very good\\n- anger in all of my relationships. And then what I start to do is I start to react when people are 70% happy. Even though they\\'re still happy, I\\'m like, oh my god, this person is upset with me. And then I\\'ll start to ask them, hey, why are you mad at me? But the person\\'s like, I\\'m not mad at you, I feel okay. Like I\\'m a little bit frustrated, but it\\'s not that big of a deal. Oh my god, why are you frustrated? What did I do wrong? And then what they\\'ll sort of do is create these frustrating dynamics with the relationships that they\\'re in. So now we\\'re going to talk a little bit about what do we understand about the development of BPD? So we know that there\\'s a high correlation between trauma and BPD, but my favorite theory of this actually comes from Marshall Inahan who is the developer of something called dialectical behavioral therapy. Brilliant psychologist who, if memory serves correctly, I could be wrong here, but I think she herself has BPD and kind of talks about that. And so what she sort of believes is that we have, in order to develop BPD, what we need is a neuroscientific vulnerability, i.e. a brain that is sensitive to negative emotion, plus an invalidating environment. So you can have a brain that\\'s sensitive to negative emotion, but if you grow up in the right environment, what that sort of means is that you\\'ll get enough emotional reassurance to where you\\'ll learn that like over time, like when you\\'re four years old, five years old, that even though I feel really angry, my parents are there to kind of create a safe space for me so I can kind of calm down and I can develop some security. I can start to feel good about myself even though I was feeling bad a little while ago. And on the flip side, what we kind of see is if you have that neurological vulnerability to intense negative emotions and you are in an invalidating environment, what that sort of does is like, then when those negative emotions arise, like they get amplified and they don\\'t get toned down by your environment. So what this also means is that if you have a neurotypical brain in an invalidating environment, but if you aren\\'t neurologically sensitive to that negative emotion, even if the environment is somewhat invalidating, it\\'s not that big of a deal because your brain is able to sort of like regulate its own emotions internally. So this is why there\\'s a correlation with trauma, but what we tend to see is that some people with BPD don\\'t grow up in necessarily traumatic households. Some of them will really grow up in invalidating environments. And then you\\'ll have like invalidating environments. Let\\'s say your mom is invalidating, but you\\'ve got three kids in the household. And only one of them will grow up with BPD, even though they all have the same invalidating an environment. When what\\'s the reason for that is because the other two kids have brains that are not sort of like have an itchy trigger finger when it comes to negative emotion. So I really like this\\n- who are not aware of their emotions Can\\'t manage them. So this is where like, here\\'s the tricky thing. So if I\\'m not aware that my negative emotions are building up, how am I supposed to healthily cope with them? right? Because the goal of overcoming an addiction is you have to develop healthy coping mechanisms. Fantastic. Let\\'s develop healthy coping mechanisms. Let\\'s meditate. But if I\\'m not even aware that I\\'m feeling anxious, like I\\'m not even going to bother  feeling anxious, like I\\'m not even gonna bother to meditate. Does that make sense? So in order to develop healthy coping mechanisms, we have to know when we need to cope in a healthy manner. And if we\\'re a lexatimic, we don\\'t even realize it. So let\\'s move on. Now we get into some real problems. So here\\'s what we tend to find in people who are lexithymic and what their relationships look like. Oftentimes, they are cold and distant when it comes to communication. So in their relationships, they like feel distant. So this is what we would call emotional unavailability. I\\'m looking for someone who\\'s emotionally available. That\\'s someone who is not cold and distant. Let\\'s think about what the opposite is, right? So warm and present. This equals emotional availability. And I want you all to think a little bit about, okay, if you\\'re cold and distant in a relationship, think about your parents, right? Were their, your parents warm and present or were they cold and distant? A second feature, if you look at the science of Alexathymia and look at, if you take people who are Alexithymic and look at what else at what other communication patterns do you see? The other thing, you\\'re all going to love this, social, non-assertive communication. So sometimes this is social anxiety or we call this social anxiety. I\\'m not saying that they have a social anxiety disorder. What I\\'m saying is that people who are socially non-assertive with communication have difficulty walking up to someone and initiating a conversation. They have difficulty advocating for themselves, right? They\\'re non-assertive in their communication style, so they\\'re passive. So this is their communication style, so they\\'re passive. So this is the person who will go to a party and will stand there in the corner and wait for someone to talk to them. And we call that social anxiety. But this is actually associated with Alexithymia. Okay, next thing, this is the beta mindset, right? So I\\'m going to draw a pretty broad correlation here. I\\'m not saying that this is real, but what I\\'m saying is if you listen to people who talk about being betas or get called betas, they\\'re non-assertive communicators, right? So they\\'re people who will like have lots of feelings but then like won\\'t go and ask someone out. So I think, I know it sounds kind of weird, but I think a lot of like people like this, you don\\'t have to go and take the red pill and become an ultra-chat or things like that. What you actually just need to do is be aware of what your internal\\', evaluate the truthfulness of the following claims. Score each claim on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means the claim is completely false or unsupported by the context, and 10 means the claim is entirely true and supported by the context. Ensure that the full range of scores is utilized, not just the two extremes, to prevent the scoring from being binary in nature. Make sure that any claim supported in the context should score over 5.Claims that are true but not supporrted by the context should score less than 5 but near to itInclude a rationale for each score to explain why the claim received that rating based on the facts presented in the context.

            "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Given the context: \\'The retrieved context includes the following items:\\n- then they\\'re like, they just get distracted by something and then they like, they just get distracted by it and then they get punished for it. And then they feel bad because they don\\'t even really realize what they did wrong, right? They sort of connect the dots afterward, but in the moment, their mind just like switches gears and they forget. There\\'s another thing, they get perceived as forgetful. Right, so oh, like this person is just forgetful. Like, their memory is terrible. I\\'ve even had this. So I one time had a dude come into my office and say, like, I think I may have dementia, and  office and say like, I think I may have dementia. And the dude was like in his like late 20s. And I was like, why do you think you have dementia? I was like, that\\'s bizarre. Like, I don\\'t hear that every day. They\\'re like, well, my memory is just terrible. And I was like, well, tell me about that. And he\\'s like, well, my wife tells me I forget stuff all the time. So we started talking about it. And then like the more that I realize, like, oh, this guy doesn\\'t have a memory problem. he has like an attention problem. So this is where if we remember, so if we think about like memories stored in our brain, let\\'s say this is where memories are stored. Remember, they have to get in, they have to get put in somewhere and then they have to get put in somewhere and then they have to get recalled. And so if this is missing, or you can\\'t recall it properly, we think, oh, like, it, you know, I wasn\\'t able to recall it. But the truth is it never got planted in in the first place. So a good example of this is if someone tells me, if I ask, like, so this is a classic example, okay? The easy example of understanding attention versus recall. Who here meets a bunch of people at a party and forgets their names? Right? Like, it doesn\\'t have to be a bunch of people. It can even be one person. You meet one person, you\\'re like, it can even be one person. You meet one person, you\\'re like, hey, my name\\n- you forget everything easily, which is an upside. So I\\'m kind of curious. How has that helped you? Oh, how it\\'s helped me to forget things? Uh, I don\\'t know, like, I mean, I guess an example I could think of right now is because a chat or like Twitch chat. Like, let\\'s say, someone makes me really mad. Uh, a lot of times, like, I\\'ll hear my friends say that like, oh, you know, Twitch was chat was terrible today, blah, blah, blah. And yeah, sometimes my chat could get bad too. Everyone\\'s can. And when it happens for my chat, for me, I forget about it in 20 minutes. I don\\'t remember. Like, oh, sure. Like, uh... So... Let me ask you something in a different way, Miss Giff. If you didn\\'t forget everything in 20 minutes, what would your mind be like? What would have, what would you have held on to? Memories? Yeah, so good memories, any particular bad ones? I realize this is kind of weird because I\\'m asking you to remember that which you have forgot. Yeah, it\\'s an impossible situation. I remember a lot of bad memories with my family. Not a lot of good ones though. I don\\'t remember a lot of the good times. I just remember a lot of like, oh, this person died. I remember what happened when this person died or this guy died. I don\\'t really remember when we had fun. I just remember when he died. Or like my dog died like a couple of months ago. And I\\'m like, I don\\'t remember. And I remember all the bad times, like I had to go catch him because he was in the highway running around or jumping on my neighbors and them threatening to sue us, but I don\\'t remember the times where you would just hang out. I don\\'t remember any of it. All I remember is him being horrible. So how do you understand that? That it seems like you actually hold on to a lot of the bad, very little of the good. Yeah, I don\\'t know. Maybe it\\'s because I,, but yeah, I do that. I think of a lot of the bad, but not the good. Maybe it\\'s because I\\'m... I don\\'t know. This may miss maybe a stretch, but I\\'m very future,\\n- oh, remember  this remember we did this my brother will say stuff my sister will say stuff people say stuff I don\\'t remember any of it my parents will talk about times where we went to the water park I don\\'t remember we went to a water park my My parents would talk about this, you know, my grandma recently died. I don\\'t remember anything from her house. I remember her house. I remember, you know, one or two things, but I don\\'t remember as much as I wish I did. I don\\'t remember a lot of the things. And partially, I wish I took more pictures when I was younger, but I didn\\'t because I had acne, but I partially think that it\\'s because I just, I wasn\\'t there in the present moment thinking about it. I was thinking about other things or my future or problems. I don\\'t know. Being in the present is very hard for me, it just is. Yeah. And I\\'m also kind of noticing that, it really has cost you a lot. It\\'s almost like your brain is like, you know, a colander that\\'s just like leaking memories and then you\\'re sort of not left with anything. Yeah, it doesn\\'t feel and I mean. Yeah, I mean and partially it, you know, there\\'s pros and cons to everything in life. And one of the pros of that is I forget everything so fast. So if something bad happens to me, I forget it in 20 minutes. And I\\'m like, whatever, you know, next thing. So it\\'s easier in that way where I forget everything, but at the same time, you don\\'t really have a lot of memories. Like I played World of Warcraft for 10 years, and I don\\'t remember a single thing. Let me ask you something. Is there something that happened to you that you really, that some part of your mind thought it was really important to forget? Like a childhood experience? It\\'s interesting. Like a childhood experience. It\\'s interesting. You kind of said that you forget everything easily, which is an upside. So I\\'m kind of curious. How has that helped you? Oh, how it\\'s helped me to forget things? Uh, I don\\'t know, like, I mean, I guess an example I could\\n- Tick-Tock turns out it is also correct, right? But if you don\\'t have a body double, if you don\\'t have someone who can come over, there may be some baseline level of stimulation that you can increase, like white noise or listening to music or things like that, that can also work. Okay? Being here is going to help me out a lot, but you can help yourself to anything in the f- and I would never use them. So, it kind of makes sense, but it also this also sort of makes sense, right, because people with ADHD will be very activated by stimuli. So if you see the vegetables, you\\'ll like open the thing and you\\'ll be like, oh yeah, I have vegetables. And so it\\'s kind of like, like building your environment to be suited towards your attention span. Kind of feels like a sin. I\\'m telling you, it works for me. Hey, don\\'t put that down. Here\\'s where things get tricky. Put it away. Oh, don\\'t put it down. Put it away. Don\\'t put it down. Put it away. So I think this is great advice for keeping your place clean. Here\\'s the problem with that. So if we think about the brain, what is the part of our brain that allows us to put it down instead of putting it away? So let\\'s like think about this, okay? What is the sequence of events from putting it down to putting it away? So the first thing that you\\'ve got to do, and I\\'ll kind of ask all this question. So when people with ADHD put things down, are they aware when they put things down? So the first problem is that there\\'s a lack of awareness when you put something down, right? That\\'s why people forget. People with ADHD don\\'t forget. There\\'s no problem with their memory. Their problem is actually with their inability to attend. It never sinks in in the first place. It\\'s not a problem with retrieval. So if this kind of makes sense, if we think about memory, something goes into our memory and then we recall it. And so what happens is when I ask myself, where are my keys? I can\\'t recall, so I assume that I have a problem with my memory. I have forgetfulness. It\\'s not forgetfulness. It\\'s that you weren\\'t paying attention when you put them down in the first place. So there\\'s nothing down in the first place. So there\\'s nothing down here. This is empty, right? Because this is actually where the problem is in ADHD. So this is challenging because putting it down, putting it away instead of putting it down is a fantastic idea. Love it. The challenge is that that is actually twice as hard for ADHD people as it is for neurotypical people, because they have a lack of attention. They don\\'t realize they\\'re putting it down in the first place. The second thing is even if they do realize it, you have to restrain an impulse to put it down and then use goal-directed behavior, right? I have to stop myself, and then like, I have to plan and execute, okay, I should like go over here and put it over there. So if you kind of think about that, these are actually all the weaknesses of a brain with ADHD. These are what where we know they\\'re you know\\', evaluate the truthfulness of the following claims.

            "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Given the context: \\'The retrieved context includes the following items:\\n- think that that could help? May help your other relationships as well. So as you take this, as you take this approach, you\\'re going to start to isolate these kinds of things, and then you\\'re going to start working on them. This is what we mean by accepting responsibility. You\\'re going to start to fix those actions. And the beautiful thing is, as you start to fix those actions, you separate things from your ego. As you separate things from your ego. As you separate things from your ego and you start to take the right action, you remove bad feelings and bad outcomes. And if you stop and really think about it, right, so we\\'re going to end by talking about the narcissists. What is it that the narcissists never does? They never change their fucking behavior. They never change what they say. They keep on insisting that the problem is within them, but the whole reason that it\\'s so infuriating is because they do not focus on the things that are outside of them. And so if you want to take things less personally, it will help you so much. Practice a little bit of empathy, look at what other people are seeing. And you don\\'t get to answer what they\\'re seeing a loser. That is not something you can see, right? Even in the case of a loser, what is a loser? Maybe it\\'s someone who\\'s overweight, maybe it\\'s someone who doesn\\'t wear properly fit in clothing, maybe it\\'s someone who doesn\\'t groom themselves properly. Boom, action item number one, action item number two, action item number three. So literally look at things through other people\\'s eyes. Look at things, look at the manifestations of what you feel makes you take things personally, and then focus on those things. It\\'ll improve your life and it\\'ll prove the way that you feel. Last thing is that there are a couple of other things involved with this, things like ego and stuff like that. We have other sources that we talk about the relationship of what activates the ego because taking things personally is a narcissistic defense\\n- specifically is because of something within yourself, right? So let\\'s kind of look at it seems like everyone I meet is a functioning alcoholic and wastes their money. Peer pressure led me to going through an alcoholic phase of my own and I was throwing money away. Does that sound like anyone we know? Right? And this is also like, I also say it in kind of a meme sense, but let\\'s be clear, this is almost a survival mechanism because if you are, if this has happened to you, what is the lesson that your brain is going to learn. Steer clear of functional alcoholics who waste their money, right? Because you got pulled into this once before, it\\'s actually very logical. But at the same time, you\\'ve got to be very logical. But at the same time, you\\'ve got to be very careful, because if you\\'re rejecting a class of people, which is exactly what you yourself suffered from, then you\\'ve got to be kind of careful from that, right? Because a lot of that rejection is then, so people will talk about things like projection or displacement or reaction formation. So what do these things mean? So projection is when, you know, if I\\'m cheating on my spouse, I will be paranoid and I will like be like thinking like, you\\'re cheating on me, aren\\'t you? You\\'re cheating on me, aren\\'t you? It\\'s like actually coming from me, but I project it out onto other people. The other thing that could happen is displacement, where I\\'m truly angry with myself for falling for this crap, but I\\'m taking the anger that I have towards myself and I am displacing it onto other people. Like those function alcoholics, those dumb asses, they\\'re such terrible people. And then reaction formation is somewhat similar, so like the best example that I have a reaction formation is the homophobic homosexual. So some people grow up in a particular environment where they are taught to hate something or they\\'re taught about homosexuality and how homosexuality is bad and they themselves are homosexual. And so the only way they\\n- child. They\\'re not the right influence. My golden child. They\\'re not as good as you. This is conditioning. We can see it. Like this person even says like, you know, I want to help. Right? So he wants to help people. He wants to engage with people. I\\'m assuming it\\'s a he for a second. I don\\'t know why, but he or she wants to help people. Right? So this person wants to help people, right? So this person wants to help people, but like, what does their mind tell them? Like their mind is just incredibly, incredibly judgmental. So the first thing is that, you know, if we kind of think about like kids who grow up racist, like why are they racist is because of what they\\'ve been conditioned to be. The second thing here is that this person longs for connection. The main thing that they\\'re feeling is lonely. And when we start to feel lonely, it\\'s, that can manifest in all kinds of weird ways. And the loneliness can almost be a protective mechanism. So remember that the things that hurt us in life that are hard to kick are often doing something for us, otherwise we wouldn\\'t do them. So our brain is really, really good at figuring out like what\\'s a good deal and what\\'s a bad deal. And if you find yourself stuck in a situation where you\\'re torturing yourself or you feel like you\\'re lonely and you can\\'t make friends, like there\\'s something else going on underneath the surface. So the other thing to kind of point out is we say like, OK, the other reason that I kind of mentioned connection here is they talk about it as well. But what this person wants is, you know, I try to have deep philosophical discussions. That\\'s what this person really wants. So what they want is the discussion. So they\\'re not saying I want to read a book. They\\'re not interested in knowledge. Right? What they\\'re interested in is discussion. And they\\'re unable to find people who can engage in discussion. Like, for whatever reason, it just doesn\\'t seem to be, they seem to be kind of missing out on this. So there are a couple of things that are like really important here. The next is when we had this sort of system of enforced loneliness and we are judgmental, when we are lonely due to judgmentalness, what\\'s going on? A couple of things, okay? The first is that for people who have problems with self-esteem and wind up lonely, they sometimes will employ the defense mechanism of, I\\'m a reject you before you reject me. Okay? Okay, so I\\'m going to ask you all a question. What do you think what this person would do if they found someone who was able to engage in a deep philosophical discussion, let\\'s say that there was someone who was like a PhD student in philosophy who really knew what they were talking about. What do you think what happened? Would the person engage with them? Right? It\\'s interesting, right? So no one saying this person would be thrilled and be like, this is exactly what I\\'m looking for. So there could be a really interesting cognitive bias. The only people I see are like\\n- Or your mom called you stupid. And so you like learn to call other people stupid. We see this from this person\\'s dad too, where the dad doesn\\'t know how to form relationships. This person literally was not taught how to form relationships. That\\'s a skill that most of us just learn because our parents, like, have relationships. And so when we\\'re three years old, and we don\\'t understand what\\'s going on, but my dad has an argument with his best friend and they start yelling at each other and they just ignore me because they\\'re caught up in it, but I\\'m still watching it, right? It\\'s still getting like laid down in my brain in some way to shape or form. So this person just was conditioned to think this way. Secondly, they\\'re incredibly lonely, right? They\\'re not looking for knowledge, they\\'re looking for discussion. They want to be challenged. They want to challenge other people. What they\\'re looking for is respect. But respect is mutual. And you can\\'t have mutual respect unless you respect the other person. What I\\'m hearing is that when there\\'s judgment, there\\'s not a whole lot of respect. So you\\'re never going to have mutual respect, you\\'re never going to have relationship. You have to start by respecting the other person. Right? Like, if you want a friend, if you\\'re lonely, you need mutual respect to have friendships, but as long as you\\'re not respecting the other person, then like, how\\'s I ever going to happen? Another thing to be careful about is that sometimes we hate in others that which we cannot fix in ourselves and we understandably want to avoid those kinds of people because they\\'re bad influences. And so we try to surround ourselves with the right people, the opposite. But we can try to surround ourselves with whoever we want to and those people can absolutely be good influences, but the problems I\\'m going to carry with me, like, you know, they\\'re going to come with you to some degree. So you\\'ve got to work on that. And the last thing to kind of think a\\', evaluate the truthfulness of the following claims. Score each claim on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means the claim is completely false or unsupported by the context, and 10 means the claim is entirely true and supported by the context. Ensure that the full range of scores is utilized, not just the two extremes, to prevent the scoring from being binary in nature. Make sure that any claim supported in the context should score over 5.Claims that are true but not supporrted by the context should score less than 5 but near to itInclude a rationale for each score to explain why the claim received that rating based on the facts presented in the context.

Can you help me understand stuff or guide me in some way? And some therapists may feel really uncomfortable with that. They may turn that around into a question. Why do you feel like you need more guidance? I don\\'t know, because this doesn\\'t seem to be helping very much. So you can just ask them to change their style a little bit. And the third thing that you can do if number one and number two don\\'t work is after two or three sessions I would just go to them and say, hey, I don\\'t feel like I\\'m actually getting a whole lot out of this therapy.

So oddly enough, I\\'m still recommending that y\\'all try psychotherapy, because it is still an evidence-based, very effective approach. The other thing to consider, though, is that a lot of emotions live in our body, and as men, sometimes we need to do more bodily stuff.

One is either we work on it, and then we actually make a breakthrough of some kind and now we\\'re really jiving together, or I recommend that the person go\\n- therapy, literally what we\\'re training these people to do is see things through other people\\'s eyes. So ask yourself if you get something that makes you feel bad and you\\'re taking it personally you feel like a POS. Look at the other person\\'s perspective and ask what are they seeing. Now the other thing that you can do is literally ask them. What are you seeing that I\\'m doing, what are the behaviors that bother you, what are the words that bother you, like help me understand. So what we want to do is try to externalize our perception and look at ourselves, or look at what they see. The next thing that we want to do is try to focus on when you say I am a POS and you take things personally. That is going to result in once again, certain manifestations. So what are the manifestations? Is it that I don\\'t text people back fast enough? Is it that what is that what are the manifestations of being a POS and as you examine the manifestations you are going to start to discover things over here and then comes the most important step is once you start to isolate these things and this is a beautiful thing. They don\\'t even need to be right, right? So a lot of my patients will get hung up. What if I\\'m wrong about this? Right? What if I\\'m wrong about, let\\'s say, this person says I\\'m not invested in the friendship. And I ask them, okay, what does this person see? Well, they text me and I don\\'t text them back. And then my patients will ask, well, what if I\\'m wrong? What if that\\'s the wrong thing and that\\'s not really the problem that is in the relationship? This is where I say, I don\\'t care. What do you, how do you feel about texting people back more frequently? Like, do you think that would improve your life in some way? Do you think that would improve your life in some way? Do you think that that could help? May help your other relationships as well. So as you take this, as you take this approach, you\\'re going to start to isolate these kinds of things, and then you\\'re going to\\n- of therapy? Just think about this, the therapist is like he needs to understand why he\\'s lost his privileges. What the fuck? The therapist isn\\'t even bothering to ask why are you playing games in the first place? The why do you think the kid isn\\'t going into therapy? It\\'s because the kid doesn\\'t have a voice. It\\'s like therapy is being used as a tool of manipulation and control by the dad. He needs to articulate why he\\'s been a bad boy and we took the games away. Then he\\'ll get them back. Maybe the purpose of therapy is to ask the kid, what\\'s going on, man? Why are you playing the games? Are you struggling? What\\'s it been like being at home? Like, maybe start there. Maybe start by actually engaging with your child and asking them, what\\'s going on with you it seems like you\\'re struggling? Can I help? Maybe ask your kid can I help instead of here let me fix it for you and punish you with a side of punishment. Here\\'s a here\\'s a main course. Here\\'s a fix-it burger with a side of punishment. Maybe ask, can I help? What\\'s going on? Try to understand. Because now the kid has figured out the Trump card. Okay? Psychosomatic illness. So I\\'ve seen this so much. So like, you know, I arguably I specialize in a lot of things, but I\\'d say like at some point 30 or 40 percent of like the referrals that I got were people with psychosomatic illness. So psychosomatic illness is like one of these things where there\\'s some kind of symptom, and we\\'ll talk about this in a second. There\\'s like some kind of symptom or like illness that like can\\'t be medically explained. So headaches are a good example of this. Brain fog is another good example of this. IBS or irritable bowel syndrome. Pots, postural, orthostatic, tachycardic syndrome is another good example of this. Various autoimmune conditions. Fibromyalgia, CPRS, sorry, CRPS, complex regional pain syndrome, like eczema, headaches, like these are all things that are psychosomatic in nature. And so what happens is when like when the mind\\', evaluate the truthfulness of the following claims. Score each claim on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means the claim is completely false or unsupported by the context, and 10 means the claim is entirely true and supported by the context. Ensure that the full range of scores is utilized, not just the two extremes, to prevent the scoring from being binary in nature. Make sure that any claim supported in the context should score over 5.Claims that are true but not supporrted by the context should score less than 5 but near to itInclude a rationale for each score to explain why the claim received that rating based on the facts presented in the context. Use the following JSON schema for your output: {\\n  \"$defs\": {\\n    \"Score\": {\\n      \"properties\": {\\n        \"string\": {\\n          \"title\": \"String\",\\n          \"type\": \"string\"\\n        },\\n        \"rationale\": {\\n          \"title\": \"Rationale\",\\n          \"type\": \"string\"\\n        },\\n        \"score\": {\\n          \"title\": \"Score\",\\n          \"type\": \"integer\"\\n        }\\n      },\\n      \"required\": [\\n        \"string\",\\n        \"rationale\",\\n        \"score\"\\n      ],\\n      \"title\": \"Score\",\\n      \"type\": \"object\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"properties\": {\\n    \"scores\": {\\n      \"items\": {\\n        \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/Score\"\\n      },\\n      \"title\": \"Scores\",\\n      \"type\": \"array\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"required\": [\\n    \"scores\"\\n  ],\\n  \"title\": \"ScoredOutput\",\\n  \"type\": \"object\"\\n}'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\\n  \"sentences\": []\\n}'}]\n",

Avoidance involves mentally or physically checking out of the situation, suppression involves pushing down emotions, and reappraisal involves reframing the situation to change the emotional response.\\n\\nSelf-soothing is an important skill for emotional regulation, and it can be learned through practice and experience. Some effective self-soothing techniques include:\\n\\n1. Deep breathing: Taking slow, deep breaths can help calm the body and mind.\\n2. Progressive muscle relaxation: Tensing and relaxing different muscle groups can help release physical tension.\\n3. Mindfulness meditation: Focusing on the present moment can help reduce worry and anxiety.\\n4. Physical comfort: Engaging in physical activities like exercise, yoga, or massage can help release tension and improve mood.\\n5.

One is either we work on it, and then we actually make a breakthrough of some kind and now we\\'re really jiving together, or I recommend that the person go see someone else. And what\\'s my duty as a doctor or someone\\'s duty as a therapist? It\\'s to help the person, not help the person myself. It means giving that person whatever kind of help they need. So oddly enough, I\\'m still recommending that y\\'all try psychotherapy, because it is still an evidence-based, very effective approach. The other thing to consider, though, is that a lot of emotions live in our body, and as men, sometimes we need to do more bodily stuff. So there are studies that show that Tai Chi and yoga, for example, are effective treatments for a lot of things like mood disorders or anxiety or things like that. So adding a physical component to your emotional health is very, very helpful. The other thing to consider is that there\\'s a range of new and kind of in vogue things called somatic therapies. So these are therapies that incorporate the body in some way. So good examples of this are EMDR or EFT, which is the emotional freeing technique or tapping. So when I first encountered these studies about 10 or 15 years ago, and I used to sort of, my area of interest was evidence-based complementing alternative medicine. I thought all this stuff was like kind of BS, right? So it\\'s like the idea behind tapping is that your emotions are stored in your body and that you can tap on certain parts to free emotions. And I was like, this doesn\\'t make any sense, this is all BS. And it turns out that over the last decade or so, there have been some studies that actually show that this is a pretty effective technique. We\\'re not really 100% sure. You know, the studies aren\\'t super high quality, but there\\'s more and more evidence that stuff that is not classically effective may be effective. And specifically that a lot of somatic therapies seem to be gaining a lot of weight and\\n- to regulate their emotions results in three coping strategies. Avoidance, suppression, or reappraisal. Avoidance is when we kind of mentally check out from the thing, we either avoid the situation entirely. We literally don\\'t go. So we can physically check out of the situation or what we\\'ll do is mentally check out of the situation. So we\\'ll even go to the place, but we\\'ll devalue something in my mind so that it doesn\\'t, I don\\'t have to be hurt by it, right? So I kind of go AFK in a situation. That\\'s absolutely a tactic used to overcome my disordered emotions to begin with. It\\'s a coping mechanism. So healthier than that is suppression where at least I feel the emotion, but I push it down. So there\\'s internal conflict versus mentally checking out. And then the third and healthiest thing is reappraisal, which is when I kind of work through the emotion I end up like looking at the emotion and I end up like looking at the silver lining or realizing that okay even though I got you know even though my partner dumped me like in the grand scheme of things like there are other people out there I learned a lot from the relationship. I\\'m going to know better what mistakes not to make next time. That\\'s an example of reappraisal. So we can see how apathy to success absolutely falls into that avoidance category as a coping strategy against your difficult emotional regulation, which we once again know that people with ADHD have. So that\\'s consistent, apathetic with success. The last thing that I\\'ll mention, which is a little bit different, which is a little bit more from the yogic perspective or the Eastern perspective, is when you\\'re a child with ADHD, and it\\'s hard for you to succeed because you have certain neurological disadvantages in terms of like attention and things like that. One of the things that you have to learn how to do is divorce yourself from success. And this is a protective mechanism. So I want you to put yourself in the shoes of like a 12-year-old who has\\n- don\\'t stress about it. Now if you guys want some of these techniques of how to observe and things like that, I definitely recommend you check out our meditation guide. We\\'ll teach you about a lot of this mental training. But all you need to do is observe the vassana. So at the end of the day, you\\'ll need to be a little bit careful about venting. Venting can be absolutely healthy if it precedes action, if it helps stabilize you because too much negative emotion is overwhelming. We want to modulate that negative emotion down to where we still have enough emotional energy to motivate to act. This is what a therapist does, but if you don\\'t do this, if instead you just vent for the sake of venting and then you vent again and vent again, vent again, you\\'re forming a mental habit. And then the real problem with that mental habit is that mental habit will make it harder for you to do something because now your body has a habituated response. When this problem happens, how do I deal with it? I bitch about it. So now it becomes harder and harder and harder. It\\'s kind of like, you know, once you train yourself to be right-handed It\\'s it\\'s hard to start writing with your left hand So once your mind trains with a particular vassina of this is how I\\'m going to deal with this problem, I\\'m just going to bitch about it, it becomes harder and harder and harder to work with your left hand to actually do something about your problem. So be careful about venting and observe your vassanas. you\\n- self-compassion? And this is what\\'s really important to understand. Is that for about half of patience, the single most revolutionary thing you can do for them is to teach them self-love. So I think the reason that we\\'re biased this way as the field of therapy is because for half of the people, if we can teach them self-compassion, all of their problems will be fixed. And that\\'s kind of the goal of therapy, right? That\\'s the approach, is that like, the problem isn\\'t that you lack knowledge to solve this particular thing. The problem is that there knowledge to solve this particular thing. The problem is that there\\'s something inside you that as long as it\\'s broken and isn\\'t really functioning properly, you can try to go on fixing things out there and it\\'ll never work. And that\\'s a really valid approach. Like literally in my practice, I\\'d say like the most transformative thing is teaching people self-love, but for half the people. The real problem is that for the other half it doesn\\'t seem to work Because not everyone is traumatized and not everyone sort of needs more self-love and self-compassion and in, for half the people that walk into my office, if I tell them, hey, bro, you need more self-love. They hate it. Because these are people, and you may be one of them, that don\\'t deserve self-love that don\\'t deserve self-love. You don\\'t deserve compassion, because you suck at life, right? And like, I\\'m not here to teach myself how to love this pathetic version of me. This is not what I\\'m interested in. I actually don\\'t want to love this person. Give yourself love to someone who deserves it. What I actually want to do is create a life that I can be proud of. Something where I deserve love and confidence and like all that good stuff is like appropriate. And if people come into our office that way, unfortunately a lot of my colleagues will be like, no, no, you need to suffer love, eh, eh, you are to self love. Yeah, eh. You are deserving of love. You\\'re not pathetic. Like\\', evaluate the truthfulness of the following claims. Score each claim on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means the claim is completely false or unsupported by the context, and 10 means the claim is entirely true and supported by the context. Ensure that the full range of scores is utilized, not just the two extremes, to prevent the scoring from being binary in nature. Make sure that any claim supported in the context should score over 5.Claims that are true but not supporrted by the context should score less than 5 but near to itInclude a rationale for each score to explain why the claim received that rating based on the facts presented in the context.

            "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Given the context: \\'The retrieved context includes the following items:\\n- Because then one of two things happen. One is either we work on it, and then we actually make a breakthrough of some kind and now we\\'re really jiving together, or I recommend that the person go see someone else. And what\\'s my duty as a doctor or someone\\'s duty as a therapist? It\\'s to help the person, not help the person myself. It means giving that person whatever kind of help they need. So oddly enough, I\\'m still recommending that y\\'all try psychotherapy, because it is still an evidence-based, very effective approach. The other thing to consider, though, is that a lot of emotions live in our body, and as men, sometimes we need to do more bodily stuff. So there are studies that show that Tai Chi and yoga, for example, are effective treatments for a lot of things like mood disorders or anxiety or things like that. So adding a physical component to your emotional health is very, very helpful. The other thing to consider is that there\\'s a range of new and kind of in vogue things called somatic therapies. So these are therapies that incorporate the body in some way. So good examples of this are EMDR or EFT, which is the emotional freeing technique or tapping. So when I first encountered these studies about 10 or 15 years ago, and I used to sort of, my area of interest was evidence-based complementing alternative medicine. I thought all this stuff was like kind of BS, right? So it\\'s like the idea behind tapping is that your emotions are stored in your body and that you can tap on certain parts to free emotions. And I was like, this doesn\\'t make any sense, this is all BS. And it turns out that over the last decade or so, there have been some studies that actually show that this is a pretty effective technique. We\\'re not really 100% sure. You know, the studies aren\\'t super high quality, but there\\'s more and more evidence that stuff that is not classically effective may be effective. And specifically that a lot of somatic therapies seem to be gaining a lot of weight and\\n- to regulate their emotions results in three coping strategies. Avoidance, suppression, or reappraisal. Avoidance is when we kind of mentally check out from the thing, we either avoid the situation entirely. We literally don\\'t go. So we can physically check out of the situation or what we\\'ll do is mentally check out of the situation. So we\\'ll even go to the place, but we\\'ll devalue something in my mind so that it doesn\\'t, I don\\'t have to be hurt by it, right? So I kind of go AFK in a situation. That\\'s absolutely a tactic used to overcome my disordered emotions to begin with. It\\'s a coping mechanism. So healthier than that is suppression where at least I feel the emotion, but I push it down. So there\\'s internal conflict versus mentally checking out. And then the third and healthiest thing is reappraisal, which is when I kind of work through the emotion I end up like looking at the emotion and I end up like looking at the silver lining or realizing that okay even though I got you know even though my partner dumped me like in the grand scheme of things like there are other people out there I learned a lot from the relationship. I\\'m going to know better what mistakes not to make next time. That\\'s an example of reappraisal. So we can see how apathy to success absolutely falls into that avoidance category as a coping strategy against your difficult emotional regulation, which we once again know that people with ADHD have. So that\\'s consistent, apathetic with success. The last thing that I\\'ll mention, which is a little bit different, which is a little bit more from the yogic perspective or the Eastern perspective, is when you\\'re a child with ADHD, and it\\'s hard for you to succeed because you have certain neurological disadvantages in terms of like attention and things like that. One of the things that you have to learn how to do is divorce yourself from success. And this is a protective mechanism. So I want you to put yourself in the shoes of like a 12-year-old who has\\n- don\\'t stress about it. Now if you guys want some of these techniques of how to observe and things like that, I definitely recommend you check out our meditation guide. We\\'ll teach you about a lot of this mental training. But all you need to do is observe the vassana. So at the end of the day, you\\'ll need to be a little bit careful about venting. Venting can be absolutely healthy if it precedes action, if it helps stabilize you because too much negative emotion is overwhelming. We want to modulate that negative emotion down to where we still have enough emotional energy to motivate to act. This is what a therapist does, but if you don\\'t do this, if instead you just vent for the sake of venting and then you vent again and vent again, vent again, you\\'re forming a mental habit. And then the real problem with that mental habit is that mental habit will make it harder for you to do something because now your body has a habituated response. When this problem happens, how do I deal with it? I bitch about it. So now it becomes harder and harder and harder. It\\'s kind of like, you know, once you train yourself to be right-handed It\\'s it\\'s hard to start writing with your left hand So once your mind trains with a particular vassina of this is how I\\'m going to deal with this problem, I\\'m just going to bitch about it, it becomes harder and harder and harder to work with your left hand to actually do something about your problem. So be careful about venting and observe your vassanas. you\\n- self-compassion? And this is what\\'s really important to understand. Is that for about half of patience, the single most revolutionary thing you can do for them is to teach them self-love. So I think the reason that we\\'re biased this way as the field of therapy is because for half of the people, if we can teach them self-compassion, all of their problems will be fixed. And that\\'s kind of the goal of therapy, right? That\\'s the approach, is that like, the problem isn\\'t that you lack knowledge to solve this particular thing. The problem is that there knowledge to solve this particular thing. The problem is that there\\'s something inside you that as long as it\\'s broken and isn\\'t really functioning properly, you can try to go on fixing things out there and it\\'ll never work. And that\\'s a really valid approach. Like literally in my practice, I\\'d say like the most transformative thing is teaching people self-love, but for half the people. The real problem is that for the other half it doesn\\'t seem to work Because not everyone is traumatized and not everyone sort of needs more self-love and self-compassion and in, for half the people that walk into my office, if I tell them, hey, bro, you need more self-love. They hate it. Because these are people, and you may be one of them, that don\\'t deserve self-love that don\\'t deserve self-love. You don\\'t deserve compassion, because you suck at life, right? And like, I\\'m not here to teach myself how to love this pathetic version of me. This is not what I\\'m interested in. I actually don\\'t want to love this person. Give yourself love to someone who deserves it. What I actually want to do is create a life that I can be proud of. Something where I deserve love and confidence and like all that good stuff is like appropriate. And if people come into our office that way, unfortunately a lot of my colleagues will be like, no, no, you need to suffer love, eh, eh, you are to self love. Yeah, eh. You are deserving of love. You\\'re not pathetic. Like\\', evaluate the truthfulness of the following claims. Score each claim on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means the claim is completely false or unsupported by the context, and 10 means the claim is entirely true and supported by the context. Ensure that the full range of scores is utilized, not just the two extremes, to prevent the scoring from being binary in nature.

The other thing, you\\'re all going to love this, social, non-assertive communication. So sometimes this is social anxiety or we call this social anxiety. I\\'m not saying that they have a social anxiety disorder. What I\\'m saying is that people who are socially non-assertive with communication have difficulty walking up to someone and initiating a conversation. They have difficulty advocating for themselves, right? They\\'re non-assertive in their communication style, so they\\'re passive. So this is their communication style, so they\\'re passive. So this is the person who will go to a party and will stand there in the corner and wait for someone to talk to them. And we call that social anxiety. But this is actually associated with Alexithymia. Okay, next thing, this is the beta mindset, right? So I\\'m going to draw a pretty broad correlation here. I\\'m not saying that this is real, but what I\\'m saying is if you listen to people who talk about being betas or get called betas, they\\'re non-assertive communicators, right? So they\\'re people who will like have lots of feelings but then like won\\'t go and ask someone out. So I think, I know it sounds kind of weird, but I think a lot of like people like this, you don\\'t have to go and take the red pill and become an ultra-chat or things like that. What you actually just need to do is be aware of what your internal emotional state is. And as you become more aware of your internal emotional state, you can start to be more assertive in communication. And this is where if you look at some of it like this community, right, they\\'re all about assertive communication. I think sometimes their assertiveness crosses the bridge into toxicity and being harmful. But I think that like this is the kind of interesting thing about that community is I think they\\'ve stumbled on a lot of good stuff, but I think their underlying mechanisms are not scientifically based. Because what you actually discover is that as you become less\\n- who are not aware of their emotions Can\\'t manage them. So this is where like, here\\'s the tricky thing. So if I\\'m not aware that my negative emotions are building up, how am I supposed to healthily cope with them? right? Because the goal of overcoming an addiction is you have to develop healthy coping mechanisms. Fantastic. Let\\'s develop healthy coping mechanisms. Let\\'s meditate. But if I\\'m not even aware that I\\'m feeling anxious, like I\\'m not even going to bother  feeling anxious, like I\\'m not even gonna bother to meditate. Does that make sense? So in order to develop healthy coping mechanisms, we have to know when we need to cope in a healthy manner. And if we\\'re a lexatimic, we don\\'t even realize it. So let\\'s move on. Now we get into some real problems. So here\\'s what we tend to find in people who are lexithymic and what their relationships look like. Oftentimes, they are cold and distant when it comes to communication. So in their relationships, they like feel distant. So this is what we would call emotional unavailability. I\\'m looking for someone who\\'s emotionally available. That\\'s someone who is not cold and distant. Let\\'s think about what the opposite is, right? So warm and present. This equals emotional availability. And I want you all to think a little bit about, okay, if you\\'re cold and distant in a relationship, think about your parents, right? Were their, your parents warm and present or were they cold and distant? A second feature, if you look at the science of Alexathymia and look at, if you take people who are Alexithymic and look at what else at what other communication patterns do you see? The other thing, you\\'re all going to love this, social, non-assertive communication. So sometimes this is social anxiety or we call this social anxiety. I\\'m not saying that they have a social anxiety disorder. What I\\'m saying is that people who are socially non-assertive with communication have difficulty walking up to someone and initiating a conversation. They have difficulty advocating for themselves, right? They\\'re non-assertive in their communication style, so they\\'re passive. So this is their communication style, so they\\'re passive. So this is the person who will go to a party and will stand there in the corner and wait for someone to talk to them. And we call that social anxiety. But this is actually associated with Alexithymia. Okay, next thing, this is the beta mindset, right? So I\\'m going to draw a pretty broad correlation here.

So they\\'re people who will like have lots of feelings but then like won\\'t go and ask someone out. So I think, I know it sounds kind of weird, but I think a lot of like people like this, you don\\'t have to go and take the red pill and become an ultra-chat or things like that. What you actually just need to do is be aware of what your internal\\n- specifically is because of something within yourself, right? So let\\'s kind of look at it seems like everyone I meet is a functioning alcoholic and wastes their money. Peer pressure led me to going through an alcoholic phase of my own and I was throwing money away. Does that sound like anyone we know? Right? And this is also like, I also say it in kind of a meme sense, but let\\'s be clear, this is almost a survival mechanism because if you are, if this has happened to you, what is the lesson that your brain is going to learn. Steer clear of functional alcoholics who waste their money, right? Because you got pulled into this once before, it\\'s actually very logical. But at the same time, you\\'ve got to be very logical. But at the same time, you\\'ve got to be very careful, because if you\\'re rejecting a class of people, which is exactly what you yourself suffered from, then you\\'ve got to be kind of careful from that, right? Because a lot of that rejection is then, so people will talk about things like projection or displacement or reaction formation. So what do these things mean? So projection is when, you know, if I\\'m cheating on my spouse, I will be paranoid and I will like be like thinking like, you\\'re cheating on me, aren\\'t you? You\\'re cheating on me, aren\\'t you? It\\'s like actually coming from me, but I project it out onto other people. The other thing that could happen is displacement, where I\\'m truly angry with myself for falling for this crap, but I\\'m taking the anger that I have towards myself and I am displacing it onto other people. Like those function alcoholics, those dumb asses, they\\'re such terrible people. And then reaction formation is somewhat similar, so like the best example that I have a reaction formation is the homophobic homosexual. So some people grow up in a particular environment where they are taught to hate something or they\\'re taught about homosexuality and how homosexuality is bad and they themselves are homosexual. And so the only way they\\n- this defense mechanism of, I\\'m a reject you before you reject me. What else is going on? When you\\'re lonely and judgmental, option number two on the differential diagnosis is we hate in others that which we cannot fix in ourselves. Key, key, key. If you find yourself rejecting a particular class of people, there\\'s a decent chance that the reason you reject them in the vein of screw you specifically is because of something within yourself, right? So let\\'s kind of look at it seems like everyone I meet is a functioning alcoholic and wastes their money. Peer pressure led me to going through an alcoholic phase of my own and I was throwing money away. Does that sound like anyone we know? Right? And this is also like, I also say it in kind of a meme sense, but let\\'s be clear, this is almost a survival mechanism because if you are, if this has happened to you, what is the lesson that your brain is going to learn.

So some people grow up in a particular environment where they are taught to hate something or they\\'re taught about homosexuality and how homosexuality is bad and they themselves are homosexual. And so the only way they can like manage those feelings is to lash out against other homosexuals. Right? So we hate in others that which we cannot fix in ourselves. So that could be going on here too. Okay. So the next thing is, if you\\'re having trouble engaging in relationships, if you\\'re lonely, so what we hear in this post is what this person wants, right? Like this is where I want to meet people but no one is interested or they want to do things where they pretend to be smart but are riddled with logical fallacies. I don\\'t think they pretend to be smart. I think they, you know, you just engage them in conversations, maybe they\\', evaluate the truthfulness of the following claims. Score each claim on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means the claim is completely false or unsupported by the context, and 10 means the claim is entirely true and supported by the context. Ensure that the full range of scores is utilized, not just the two extremes, to prevent the scoring from being binary in nature. Make sure that any claim supported in the context should score over 5.Claims that are true but not supporrted by the context should score less than 5 but near to itInclude a rationale for each score to explain why the claim received that rating based on the facts presented in the context.

There\\n- development of your brain? The short answer is we don\\'t know. So I\\'d say like steer clear that stuff, especially if you\\'re like a teenager or even your earlier, early 20s. So one person saying, how do I deal with the imposter syndrome of whether I might actually have ADHD or I\\'m just normal and lazy, especially since the waiting list for formal assessment is so long here. So if you\\'re stuck between trying to figure out, am I lazy or do I have ADHD? Really common problem? Excellent question. What do you do about it? And this is where it\\'s kind of interesting, but the short answer is it sort of doesn\\'t matter, right? So like, I know it sounds kind of weird, but whether you have a diagnostic reason for being the way that you are, or you are lazy, you still have the same shared problem, which is that you\\'re unable to do things. That problem needs to be fixed. Whether you have ADHD or you\\'re lazy, like that\\'s sort of in a weird way, it\\'s almost irrelevant. It does become relevant because ADHD may open up additional ways to fix it. So I\\'m not saying it\\'s truly irrelevant, but what I\\'m saying is that the situation is what it is. The ADHD is just a label that you put upon it, right? It may give you some amount of tools, it may give you some amount of options, but this is where I\\'d say that, you know, if there are tools to organize yourself with ADHD, they may help you even if you\\'re lazy. So this is where, you know, your situation is what it is, irrespective of what label someone will give you. And so there are things that you can do irrespective of what label you have. So what is the nature and experience of your inability to work? Ask yourself that question. That question is the same whether you have ADHD or don\\'t have ADHD. And then you ask yourself, okay, so like what is like what is it that makes it hard for me to work? Is it, is it, I feel unmotivated. What does that mean? What does unmotivation mean? Like, what does that mean to feel unmotivated? Is it that your mind is distracted? Is it that mean to feel unmotivated? Is it that your mind is distracted? Is it that you\\'re afraid of the consequences? Is it that when you start to work, like you you automatically compare yourself to other people and you think there\\'s no point in studying because this person is going to do a and you think there\\'s no point in studying because this person is going to do a better job than I am. There are all kinds of things that can impact your motivation. And so you have to understand the nature of your experience. You\\'re going to get more answers studying yourself than you will from like getting a particular label and finding external answers. And that may sound weird, you\\'re like, but wait, if I have ADHD, doesn\\'t that mean that there are all these solutions out there? News Flash is someone who treats people with ADHD, they\\'re all on the struggle bus anyway. It certainly can help and there can be transformative, you know, interventions that you can do for ADHD. I\\'m\\n- and execute tasks. So for example, if I want to like study for a test there are many things that go into studying for a test and one of the key things that I have to do when studying for a test first of all is behavioral inhibition. So I sit down to do when studying for a test, first of all, is behavioral inhibition. So I sit down to study for a test, and in order to study for the test, I have to stop myself from like doing other things, like pulling out my phone, you know, logging on to Reddit, like watching Twitch, playing video games, like going to get a snack. So there\\'s a part of my brain that when I focus it in one direction like prevents me from doing all the other things. I may have impulses to do those things, but essentially my brain is like, no, we\\'re not going to do that now. Like, we\\'ll check the phone later. So the first thing that happens in people with ADHD is that they have deficiencies and their behavioral inhibition circuitry. That kind of comes from the frontal lobe, okay, we\\'ll talk about that in a second. The second thing is that people with ADHD have altered sensitivity to reinforcement. And so what that means is that things that are low-hanging fruit and easily enjoyable are far much more enjoyable to people with ADHD. So if you look at like delayed gratification studies and people with ADHD, where you ask someone with ADHD, Hey, I\\'ll give you a dollar now or I\\'ll give you five dollars and five minutes. Which one do you want? Literally the brain of someone in ADHD $5.5 in five minutes, which one do you want? Literally the brain of someone in ADHD is going to pick the dollar now as opposed to the dollar and five dollars and five minutes. So compared to the neurotypical brain, the sensitivity to reward and reinforcement is altered in ADHD. The third thing that that happens in ADHD is a high amount of impulsivity. So people may say like is decreased inhibition the same as impulsivity and it turns out that neuroscientificly they\\'re actually like\\n- interview about ADHD. But I do think that it\\'s, you know, ADHD has advantages. Like, what\\'s it crosses the threshold of disorder? It\\'s, the reason we define it as a disorder is like because it\\'s negatively impacts your function. So if you\\'ve got super bad, you know, ADHD, chances are, it\\'s just like, it\\'s a negative, right? But that\\'s why I also prefer to sort of use the Irovetics system because I am quite ADHD, but I\\'m like subclinical. So I think Vata is a better example of like how to understand the spectrum, the bell curve of like attention across human beings. Is becoming apathetic to your successes whilst obsessing over your failure is common with ADHD? I\\'m going to say yes. So let\\'s go back to the neuroscience. So remember that... Oh man, this is so complicated. Let me just think about this. Okay. So the question is, is becoming apathetic to your successes whilst obsessing over your failure is common with ADHD? And I\\'m going to say yes. So let\\'s lean a little bit on what we\\'ve learned today, okay? And maybe y\\'all can walk through this with me. So first thing is obsessing over your failures common with ADHD. Let\\'s unpack that phrase. So the first thing is obsessing. So one of the hallmarks of ADHD is disregulated attention. So a lot of times people assume that ADHD means a very small attention span. But the truth is, if you talk to people with ADHD, what you find is disregulated attention. And what that means is that sometimes their attention is very, very small, but the flip is also true where sometimes they get so deeply absorbed in something where like everything around them ceases to exist. So this is a disorder of attention. Instead of your attention staying kind of in the middle, where you can get distracted when you need to get distracted, but you can focus when you need to focus. What you\\'ll see oftentimes in ADHD is a hyper focus to the impairment of their life. So I get so caught up in a video game that I lose all track of time. I get so obsessive\\', evaluate the truthfulness of the following claims. Score each claim on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means the claim is completely false or unsupported by the context, and 10 means the claim is entirely true and supported by the context. Ensure that the full range of scores is utilized, not just the two extremes, to prevent the scoring from being binary in nature.

            "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Given the context: \\'The retrieved context includes the following items:\\n- specifically is because of something within yourself, right? So let\\'s kind of look at it seems like everyone I meet is a functioning alcoholic and wastes their money. Peer pressure led me to going through an alcoholic phase of my own and I was throwing money away. Does that sound like anyone we know? Right? And this is also like, I also say it in kind of a meme sense, but let\\'s be clear, this is almost a survival mechanism because if you are, if this has happened to you, what is the lesson that your brain is going to learn. Steer clear of functional alcoholics who waste their money, right? Because you got pulled into this once before, it\\'s actually very logical. But at the same time, you\\'ve got to be very logical. But at the same time, you\\'ve got to be very careful, because if you\\'re rejecting a class of people, which is exactly what you yourself suffered from, then you\\'ve got to be kind of careful from that, right? Because a lot of that rejection is then, so people will talk about things like projection or displacement or reaction formation. So what do these things mean? So projection is when, you know, if I\\'m cheating on my spouse, I will be paranoid and I will like be like thinking like, you\\'re cheating on me, aren\\'t you? You\\'re cheating on me, aren\\'t you? It\\'s like actually coming from me, but I project it out onto other people. The other thing that could happen is displacement, where I\\'m truly angry with myself for falling for this crap, but I\\'m taking the anger that I have towards myself and I am displacing it onto other people. Like those function alcoholics, those dumb asses, they\\'re such terrible people. And then reaction formation is somewhat similar, so like the best example that I have a reaction formation is the homophobic homosexual. So some people grow up in a particular environment where they are taught to hate something or they\\'re taught about homosexuality and how homosexuality is bad and they themselves are homosexual. And so the only way they\\n- to intense negative emotions and you are in an invalidating environment, what that sort of does is like, then when those negative emotions arise, like they get amplified and they don\\'t get toned down by your environment. So what this also means is that if you have a neurotypical brain in an invalidating environment, but if you aren\\'t neurologically sensitive to that negative emotion, even if the environment is somewhat invalidating, it\\'s not that big of a deal because your brain is able to sort of like regulate its own emotions internally. So this is why there\\'s a correlation with trauma, but what we tend to see is that some people with BPD don\\'t grow up in necessarily traumatic households. Some of them will really grow up in invalidating environments. And then you\\'ll have like invalidating environments. Let\\'s say your mom is invalidating, but you\\'ve got three kids in the household. And only one of them will grow up with BPD, even though they all have the same invalidating an environment. When what\\'s the reason for that is because the other two kids have brains that are not sort of like have an itchy trigger finger when it comes to negative emotion. So I really like this theory. I think it\\'s very explanatory where there\\'s a neurological vulnerability plus an environmental factor. So a key thing that people sort of think about, especially when we talk about personality disorders, is does this mean I\\'m screwed? Because this is a personality disorder, right? You\\'re telling me Dr. K, that my brain is busting. I have a small amygdala and like if I\\'ve got a small amygdala and I don\\'t know who I am on the inside does that mean I\\'m essentially screwed because I engage in all these manipulative behaviors and I\\'m screwed I\\'m screwed I\\'m screwed, I\\'m screwed. The answer is actually shockingly, no. Actually, BPD is, I know it sounds kind of bizarre, but actually has one of the best prognoses of personality disorders. So the first thing to understand is that there are very good\\n- And so there may be people with like 25% risk or 75% risk. And so depending on like, you know, what the other traumatic experiences, let\\'s say this is like you\\'re in the Holocaust, so then you end up with PTSD. And let\\'s say even this person is like, you know, had a mom who never gave them like no bedtime stories. And this can result in PTSD. So you guys see like basically genetics doesn\\'t determine is not like it\\'s not a destiny. It\\'s a vulnerability that combined with a particular experience can result in the manifestation of an illness. So like the other way that I kind of think about this just to use a quick analogy is I kind of think about like the genetic vulnerability as like a seed. Okay, so like genetics is like a seed. And then depending on what kind of soil you plant the seed in, and this is where the experience is like the soil. Depending on what kind of soil you plant the seed and it can result in a plant or not a plant, right? So if like if my soil is like concrete and I take this seed and I try to plant it in concrete, it\\'s never going to grow. So like a concrete soil is sort of like what I think of is like let\\'s say a monk, right? Because they\\'re so control of their mind, they\\'re in such strong control of their mind that like even genetic vulnerabilities can be kind of like overcome. Compared to if I take you know even a seed that\\'s not very robust and not very healthy and I plant it in super fertile soil like growing up in an environment where you have parents that are like abusive and emotionally neglectful, even the, you know, the weakest seed when grown in the most fertile soil will manifest in a plant. And so then people are saying, well, okay, like I know what the next, you know, point of hopelessness is. Oh, I have a genetic vulnerability. I have a family history of like whatever, and I grew up in an unhealthy environment Does that mean that I\\'m basically screwed? And the answer is still no because remember that through experiences You can actually change the soil, right? So this continues to be malleable. So even if you have genetic vulnerabilities to particular things, by changing your environment, by changing your relationships, you can still escape the destiny that negative genetics will offer you. Does that make sense, chat? We understand that? So going back to ADHD, so there does seem to be in depression, there does seem to be a strong genetic concordance between ADHD and depression, if you drew the short end of the stick or if you drew the short end of the stick, or if you drew the short straw, sorry, doesn\\'t mean you\\'re screwed. A couple of other things to note about the genetics and sort of correlation between between ADHD and depression. So this is quite alarming. So ADHD increases your risk of depression by fivefold. Okay? So it\\'s like an increased risk. It\\'s crazy by fivefold. So you\\'re five, if you take a group of, you take a kids, and 50 of them have ADHD, and 50 of them have no ADHD, the likelihood of\\n- the studies about things like PTSD being passed down to children through epigenetics? Yeah I\\'m pretty familiar with that research so let\\'s take the question from the top. So there\\'s some evidence, okay, let\\'s just really go from the top. So the first thing is that there\\'s a field called epigenetics, which is not the actual genes, but the act how genes are turned on or turned off. So our genome, look, we\\'ve got a bunch of stuff in there, and it\\'s not necessarily the allele or like the gene, like the DNA sequence at a particular point, but like you can turn genes on and you can turn genes off. That\\'s called epigenetics. So whether genes are turned on or off actually relates to our experiences. So certain kinds of genes will be turned on by certain kinds of experiences. So an example of this is when our body gets an infection, we will activate transcription, we will turn on genes of things like heat shock proteins and other kinds of like genes in our cells that will help us fight infection. Right? So it\\'s like there\\'s a bunch of stuff that like once we get infected, our body\\'s like time to go to war, let\\'s start producing, like let\\'s turn on our armories and start producing soldiers and like, you know, cytokines that will help us fight infection. So experiences can affect our genetic activation. And so if we go back to what I was saying earlier, about what is the model of genes, right? So that\\'s where I sort of shared that genetics plus vulnerability is what results in illness. And all that kind of stuff is epigenetic. So this is also where when we kind of look at that developmental aspect, when we were talking about, okay, if you have a kid with ADHD who grows up with an ADHD brain and experiences life as a kid with ADHD with bullying and not having friends and like poor academic success, that\\'s gonna have an epigenetic impact and make you vulnerable to depression. So I believe a lot of that stuff is mediated through epigenetics. I personally have not looked into the\\', evaluate the truthfulness of the following claims. Score each claim on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means the claim is completely false or unsupported by the context, and 10 means the claim is entirely true and supported by the context. Ensure that the full range of scores is utilized, not just the two extremes, to prevent the scoring from being binary in nature. Make sure that any claim supported in the context should score over 5.Claims that are true but not supporrted by the context should score less than 5 but near to itInclude a rationale for each score to explain why the claim received that rating based on the facts presented in the context. Use the following JSON schema for your output: {\\n  \"$defs\": {\\n    \"Score\": {\\n      \"properties\": {\\n        \"string\": {\\n          \"title\": \"String\",\\n          \"type\": \"string\"\\n        },\\n        \"rationale\": {\\n          \"title\": \"Rationale\",\\n          \"type\": \"string\"\\n        },\\n        \"score\": {\\n          \"title\": \"Score\",\\n          \"type\": \"integer\"\\n        }\\n      },\\n      \"required\": [\\n        \"string\",\\n        \"rationale\",\\n        \"score\"\\n      ],\\n      \"title\": \"Score\",\\n      \"type\": \"object\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"properties\": {\\n    \"scores\": {\\n      \"items\": {\\n        \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/Score\"\\n      },\\n      \"title\": \"Scores\",\\n      \"type\": \"array\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"required\": [\\n    \"scores\"\\n  ],\\n  \"title\": \"ScoredOutput\",\\n  \"type\": \"object\"\\n}'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\\n  \"sentences\": [\\n    \"To begin with, task avoidance in ADHD is often a symptom of the condition itself, affecting attention, working memory, and impulse control.\",\\n    \"People with ADHD may avoid tasks due to difficulties with planning, organization, or self-regulation.\",\\n    \"In contrast, laziness in typical people is often a result of a lack of motivation, procrastination, or a tendency to prioritize short-term gratification over long-term goals.\",\\n    \"To accurately distinguish between the two, it\\'s essential to consider the individual\\'s behavior patterns, coping mechanisms, and environmental factors.\",\\n    \"Someone with ADHD may exhibit task avoidance due to difficulties with executive function, while someone who is lazy may avoid tasks due to a lack of motivation or a desire to prioritize other activities.\",\\n    \"It\\'s also important to recognize that both conditions can co-occur, and it\\'s not uncommon for individuals with ADHD to also experience laziness or procrastination.\",\\n    \"Therefore, a comprehensive assessment and understanding of the individual\\'s behavior, cognition, and emotional regulation are essential to make an accurate diagnosis and develop effective interventions.\",\\n    \"It\\'s also worth noting that the concept of \\\\\"calcification\\\\\" is not a widely accepted term in the field of psychology, but I understand what you\\'re getting at.\",\\n    \"You\\'re asking if repeated trauma can lead to a kind of emotional desensitization or numbness, making it difficult for an individual to regulate their emotions.\"\\n  ]\\n}'}]\n",

So check out our video on Alexathymia if you all want to. And then you can even tell your therapist that, hey, I\\'m concerned that I\\'m a little bit of lexathimic. So you\\'re signaling to them that you may not be able to participate in therapy in a default way. The next thing that you can do is ask your therapist to change their style a little bit if it isn\\'t working for you. So you can tell them, hey, I\\'ve noticed that you\\'re really quiet and then you kind of ask these questions like how do you feel over and over and over again? And then I keep answering I don\\'t know. Can you try to be a little bit more active or offer a little bit more guidance instead of being quieter and asking only open-ended questions. Can you help me understand stuff or guide me in some way? And some therapists may feel really uncomfortable with that. They may turn that around into a question. Why do you feel like you need more guidance? I don\\'t know, because this doesn\\'t seem to be helping very much. So you can just ask them to change their style a little bit. And the third thing that you can do if number one and number two don\\'t work is after two or three sessions I would just go to them and say, hey, I don\\'t feel like I\\'m actually getting a whole lot out of this therapy. So you seem to be asking certain questions that I have difficulty answering and I\\'m hoping that you can recommend a different therapist Who\\'s a little bit more active can offer a little bit more guidance or asks questions in a way that can help me understand my emotions better. And I know that this sounds mortifying, oh my God, as a dude, why would I ever do that? As anyone, as any patient, why would I ask to see a different therapist? It means that I don\\'t think they\\'re good. And it doesn\\'t mean that they\\'re not good. It just means that they\\'re not really helping you very much. Or at the minimum, you can have a conversation about what\\'s working and what isn\\'t, and then hopefully y\\'all can work through that stuff. So I as a therapist actually don\\'t feel, I mean, I feel bad in some ways, but I\\'m really grateful for all of my patients who have come to me and said, hey, Dr. K, this is not working. Because then one of two things happen. One is either we work on it, and then we actually make a breakthrough of some kind and now we\\'re really jiving together, or I recommend that the person go see someone else. And what\\'s my duty as a doctor or someone\\'s duty as a therapist? It\\'s to help the person, not help the person myself. It means giving that person whatever kind of help they need. So oddly enough, I\\'m still recommending that y\\'all try psychotherapy, because it is still an evidence-based, very effective approach. The other thing to consider, though, is that a lot of emotions live in our body, and as men, sometimes we need to do more bodily stuff. So there are studies that show that Tai Chi and yoga, for example, are effective treatments for a lot of things like mood disorders or\\n- for you.

Or at the minimum, you can have a conversation about what\\'s working and what isn\\'t, and then hopefully y\\'all can work through that stuff. So I as a therapist actually don\\'t feel, I mean, I feel bad in some ways, but I\\'m really grateful for all of my patients who have come to me and said, hey, Dr. K, this is not working. Because then one of two things happen. One is either we work on it, and then we actually make a breakthrough of some kind and now we\\'re really jiving together, or I recommend that the person go\\n- psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who then asked me a question, if a patient walks into your office and says, doctor, can you help me find a girlfriend or boyfriend? What are you supposed to say? And my dumb ass is like, yes, this is what we do in therapy. We help people accomplish their goals. And it turns out that I was wrong. And that in therapy, we do not help people accomplish their goals. The right thing to say, when someone walks in and says, hey, can you help me find a girlfriend? The right thing to say is not to say anything, not to answer the question, because heaven forbid, as a psychiatrist, you answer a patient\\'s question. Instead, you have to turn it into a question. Invite curiosity, what is it that makes you want a girlfriend? How do you feel about not having a girlfriend? Why do you think it is that you haven\\'t been able to find a girlfriend? What\\'s going on? Tell me about your feelings. Let\\'s talk. Let\\'s talk some more, let\\'s talk some even more. And this is what I found incredibly frustrating as a therapist, is that we\\'re a profession of people who don\\'t really focus on the outcomes of our patients. I know it sounds kind of paradoxical, and if you\\'re a therapist out there and you take offense to that, there\\'s a good reason that you will, and we\\'ll get to that in a second. But if we sort of look at the profession, we\\'re a profession that will do therapy with people for 20 years and we\\'ll keep on talking about feelings, talking about feelings, talking about feelings, and then like it\\'s not clear to me what the patient gets out of that. And so there are a couple of things that we have to say kind of in defensive therapy because it\\'s not all bad and it\\'s actually really good. The first is if this is so bad like why does everyone focus on self-love and self-compassion? And this is what\\'s really important to understand. Is that for about half of patience, the single most revolutionary thing you can do for them is to teach them self-love. So I think\\n- when I help them see that, you\\'re actually totally fine as a human being. It is this behavior that you need to change. And what I tend to find with my patients is when they start to realize this, not only do they feel better, right, because now I\\'m not a POS over here, and they can take corrective action. And this is what taking responsibility means. So you can take corrective action, and then as these problems start getting better, their relationships start improving, their performance starts proving, everything gets better, and they feel better, because they don\\'t feel like a POS because they recognize that the problem is outside of myself. If the problem is outside of myself, there is a clearer way to fix it. So how do we go about doing that? So literally what I want you all to do is to any time you take something personally, I want you to try to remove yourself from the equation. Try to try to remove yourself from the equation. So try to practice a little bit of empathy. Put yourself in the other person\\'s shoes and ask yourself, what do they actually see? What is the behavior? What is the behavior? What are the words? What is the visible expression? It is not identity, right? Because they have no sense of like who your identity is. Like, that\\'s not a thing that they can see. There are going to be certain thingthing that they can see. There are going to be certain things that you are doing saying certain ways that you\\'re acting that the other person is going to perceive. So the first thing that you need to do is look through the eyes of the other person, which by the way is the exact deficit that narcissists have, right? So even if we look at evidence-based treatment for narcissism, one of the treatments is something called mentalization-based therapy. And in mentalization-based therapy, literally what we\\'re training these people to do is see things through other people\\'s eyes. So ask yourself if you get something that makes you feel bad and you\\'re taking it\\', evaluate the truthfulness of the following claims. Score each claim on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means the claim is completely false or unsupported by the context, and 10 means the claim is entirely true and supported by the context. Ensure that the full range of scores is utilized, not just the two extremes, to prevent the scoring from being binary in nature. Make sure that any claim supported in the context should score over 5.Claims that are true but not supporrted by the context should score less than 5 but near to itInclude a rationale for each score to explain why the claim received that rating based on the facts presented in the context.

What are you going to do about it? So this is the really important thing that we sort of discover from the do about it. So this is the really important thing that we sort of discover from the psychology of military recruits, is that negatively expressing stuff is OK as long as there is faith underneath that like you will make it in the end. And what we actually discover is that what boot camp does to people is it improves the psychological concept called grit. And grit is the very opposite of like all this self-love and self-compassion stuff. So in 2007, there was a psychologist named Angela Duxworth who discovered this concept called grit, which is sort of like this personality characteristic, which is like people don\\'t give up. It\\'s not self-love, it\\'s not self-compassion, it\\'s not like, it\\'s related toto resilience actually is the closest thing But she basically noticed that some people like quit when things go bad and other people like stick with it And if you really look at like boot camp, what does boot camp do? It boosts grit. Hey there, thanks for watching and I\\'m glad these videos have been helpful. A lot of times I\\'ll read the comments and see people asking, well, what do I actually do about it? Which is a great question. And unfortunately the resources out there haven\\'t been that great, which is precisely why I started HG in the first place. HG coaches are trained on a curriculum that integrates my understanding of what motivates us, what paralyzes us, and most importantly, what leads to lasting behavioral change. If you\\'re ready to take the next step, HG coaches can help you build the life that you want. They\\'ve helped people build careers, help people find relationships, build networks of friends, and even do things like discover their passions or pursue hobbies. So if this sounds like something that you\\'d be interested in, check out the link in the description below. And so there\\'s an alternative to going\\n- your strengths, your support structures. And that\\'s why we have clinicians, at least so far, instead of robots. Why do we have clinicians? It\\'s because it takes a human being to integrate all of this research and sort of apply it to you and sort of figure out, okay, for your individual situation, which are the research studies that are the most applicable? And so what I\\'d recommend to anyone out there who is, you know, concerned that they may have ADHD is I wouldn\\'t default to believing that this is necessarily going to be an advantage. There\\'s also a lot of like psychological stuff about, you know, like not wanting to believe that you are ill in some way, or coming to terms with the fact that if you do have an illness, like, that just sucks and it\\'s a straight negative. And this is where, like, we want to believe, you know, that the world is an equal place. As a society, should we strive to make it equal? Absolutely. But, you know, as a medical doctor, like, I don\\'t know if I believe that the world and the universe is an equal place. I mean, I\\'ve seen like kids, eight-year-olds diagnosed with cancer, and I don\\'t think that like buying the childhood cancer flaw during character creation necessarily gives you like points elsewhere. Sometimes those kids happen to be poor. Sometimes those kids happen to have an abusive parent. And it\\'s not like I really wish it was, I wish that every human being on the planet had the same pool of points for character creation. But the sad truth is that that\\'s not how it is. And so some people really want to believe that like there\\'s some silver lining to their experience. And there may be, I don\\'t really know. But I think at the end of the day, what you\\'ve really got to do is if you\\'re concerned about it, first of all, go see a licensed clinician, right? I talk a lot about the benefits of our coaching program, but this is not really appropriate for coaching. Go see a licensed clinician, someone who\\'s actually trained in mental health\\n- involved with this, things like ego and stuff like that. We have other sources that we talk about the relationship of what activates the ego because taking things personally is a narcissistic defense mechanism. There\\'s certain meditation techniques and things like that. Check out our videos on ego. We actually have a resource pack That\\'s all about ego and confidence and then we also have things in things and stuff like Dr. Kaye\\'s guide to meditation The trauma guide and then the last thing that is very, very helpful is when we have trouble seeing things the way that they are, this is really what our coaching program excels at. So the reason that their outcomes are so good is because they are very good at being an external lens for you, right? So if you\\'re having trouble putting yourself in someone else\\'s shoes or seeing what they see, that\\'s exactly what a coach is for. They\\'re there to look at things from the outside and share that information with you in an actionable way. So depending on what y\\'all are interested, check out more stuff. Thanks for making it to the end of the video and let us know if this actually makes sense to you or not. So is it you or is it me or does it work out or let us know? you\\n- to make myself feel a different way. On the flip side though, sometimes we actually want to use that. And this is where I got kind of curious about military recruits. And like, let\\'s remember that military recruits will oftentimes join the military because they are unhappy with their lives and they\\'re depressed and they\\'re not going anywhere. And then after serving some period of time in the military, like sometimes there are cases of trauma and sexual assault and things like that. I\\'ve seen that working with veterans. But actually, I would say the majority of patients I work with really appreciate being in the military. They learned so much and they developed so much confidence. And what\\'s going on there? How is it that the military can be so overtly abusive, right? You\\'ve got a drill sergeant who\\'s telling you, hey, you suck. You\\'re going to fail. And and yet you come out of that experience feeling stronger. Does a swift kick in the ass actually work? And if it works, what is the underlying psychological principle at play? So let\\'s actually look at research on the psychology of people who go to boot camp. So there are a couple of really interesting aspects to it. The first is that while they are verbally abusive, which is bad, right, they actually are implicitly very, very, like, invested in you and don\\'t give up on you. I think this paradox is really important to understand. So if you go to, if you actually join the military, there\\'ll be drill sergeants and I went to a military school for a little while so I have a little bit of personal experience. Who will tell you that you\\'re gonna fail out. You\\'re pathetic, you\\'re never gonna make it, you\\'re never gonna make it, you\\'re gonna fail, you\\'re gonna fail, you\\'re so pathetic. But they never kick you out, right? They sort of teach you one really important principle, which is that even though I\\'m telling you you\\'re going to fail, I\\'m not actually going to kick you out, ever, ever. You can fail today and I\\'m going to\\', evaluate the truthfulness of the following claims. Score each claim on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means the claim is completely false or unsupported by the context, and 10 means the claim is entirely true and supported by the context. Ensure that the full range of scores is utilized, not just the two extremes, to prevent the scoring from being binary in nature. Make sure that any claim supported in the context should score over 5.Claims that are true but not supporrted by the context should score less than 5 but near to itInclude a rationale for each score to explain why the claim received that rating based on the facts presented in the context. Use the following JSON schema for your output: {\\n  \"$defs\": {\\n    \"Score\": {\\n      \"properties\": {\\n        \"string\": {\\n          \"title\": \"String\",\\n          \"type\": \"string\"\\n        },\\n        \"rationale\": {\\n          \"title\": \"Rationale\",\\n          \"type\": \"string\"\\n        },\\n        \"score\": {\\n          \"title\": \"Score\",\\n          \"type\": \"integer\"\\n        }\\n      },\\n      \"required\": [\\n        \"string\",\\n        \"rationale\",\\n        \"score\"\\n      ],\\n      \"title\": \"Score\",\\n      \"type\": \"object\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"properties\": {\\n    \"scores\": {\\n      \"items\": {\\n        \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/Score\"\\n      },\\n      \"title\": \"Scores\",\\n      \"type\": \"array\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"required\": [\\n    \"scores\"\\n  ],\\n  \"title\": \"ScoredOutput\",\\n  \"type\": \"object\"\\n}'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\\n  \"sentences\": [\\n    \"It\\'s true that many people, regardless of their profession or background, have a strong connection between their physical capabilities and their sense of self-worth.\",\\n    \"This can manifest in various ways, such as feeling proud of their physical strength, agility, or endurance, or feeling self-conscious about their physical weaknesses.\",\\n    \"One possible explanation for this link is that our physical bodies are closely tied to our sense of identity and self-image.\",\\n    \"When we feel physically capable and strong, we may feel more confident and self-assured in other areas of our lives as well.\",\\n    \"On the other hand, when we feel physically weak or vulnerable, we may feel more anxious or self-doubting.\",\\n    \"Another possible explanation is that our culture places a strong emphasis on physical strength and athleticism, particularly in areas such as sports and competition.\",\\n    \"This can create a sense of pressure to perform and achieve in these areas, which can lead to feelings of anxiety, stress, or self-doubt if we don\\'t meet our own or others\\' expectations.\",\\n    \"It\\'s also worth noting that the connection between athleticism and self-esteem can be influenced by various factors, such as upbringing, societal expectations, and personal experiences.\",\\n    \"For example, someone who grew up in a family that valued physical activity and athleticism may be more likely to develop a strong connection between their physical capabilities and their sense of self-worth.\",\\n    \"In terms of what you can do to address this link, it may be helpful to focus on developing a more balanced and realistic sense of self-worth, rather than relying solely on physical strength or athleticism.\",\\n    \"This can involve cultivating a sense of self-compassion, practicing mindfulness and self-awareness, and reframing your thoughts and attitudes around physical activity and athleticism.\"\\n  ]\\n}'}]\n",
